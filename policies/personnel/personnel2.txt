3.1. Pursuant to W.Va.

Consequently, the College may only employ individuals into temporary positions when the function of the position is expected to require less than nine (9) consecutive months of employment (regardless of hours worked per week) to equal the full-time equivalency of the position. 
3.2. Classified employees who are employed in less than twelve-month positions and who meet the minimum qualifications of a position shall be provided with an opportunity to accept part- time or full-time summer employment before new persons shall be hired for those positions. 
16.4. Work Schedules 
4.1. Pursuant to W.Va. Code §18B-7-9, the College will establish a policy, with the advice and assistance of the staff council, which shall: address any college-specific procedures concerning the use of flexible work schedules, job sharing, and four-day work weeks; discourage temporary, non-emergency changes in an employee’s work schedule; and provide a mechanism for changes in, and notification of, changes in work schedules. This policy shall also provide that, where possible, the College shall provide the employee with a fifteen (15) day notice of such changes. 
16.5. Appointment or Promotion 
5.1. Pursuant to W.Va. Code §18B-7-1(d), non-exempt classified employees who apply for and meet the minimum qualifications as determined by the College human resources director or other designee of the president for a posted non-exempt position within the College and are currently employed at the College shall be hired into the posted position prior to hiring someone from outside the College. 
5.2. If more than one qualified, non-exempt classified employee applies, the best-qualified non- exempt classified employee shall be awarded the position. In such cases, if the employees are equally qualified, the employee with the greatest amount of continuous seniority at the College shall be awarded the position. A random selection method such as drawing of lots, rolling dice, or selection of playing cards shall be utilized if two or more employees have equal qualifications and seniority. Such method shall be mutually agreed upon by the affected employees and approved by the President or her/his designee. If the employees cannot agree on a random selection method, the President of the College shall use the drawing of lots to determine rankings. 
5.3. Provisions of this section shall not apply to casual, temporary and student employees, nor shall they apply to exempt positions. 
5.4. Pursuant to W. Va. Code §18B-7-1(d), the provisions of this section shall not take precedence over the mandates in the College’s affirmative action plan adopted pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order 11246 or pursuant to any other federal or state requirement. In no event shall the College’s affirmative action plan require the use of quotas to meet its affirmative action goals or require the hiring of an unqualified person for any non-exempt position. 
16.6. Probationary Period 
6.1. Full-time regular classified employees shall serve a six-month probationary period beginning at the original date of employment. 
6.2.

As with all positions, continued employment is based on adequate funding, satisfactory performance and adherence to system and institution rules and regulations. 
16.7. Compensatory/Overtime Provisions 
7.1. Non-exempt employees may receive compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. All hours worked beyond 371⁄2 and up to and including 40 hours are calculated at the employee’s regular hourly rate. Time worked beyond 40 hours in a work week is to be calculated at a rate of one and one-half times the regular hourly rate. 
7.2. A written agreement between the employee and the College shall exist when the employee chooses compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. The written agreement may be modified at the request of either the employee or the College at any time but under no circumstances shall a change in the agreement deny the employee compensatory time heretofore acquired. 
7.3. Within 60 days of passage of this rule, the College shall develop an agreement form for compensatory time accumulation in lieu of overtime payment and shall specify the required approval process which must be completed before a non-exempt employee may work beyond 371⁄2 hours. 
7.4. Employees may accumulate up to two hundred forty hours (240 hours) of compensatory time and shall be paid for all hours worked above the maximum accrual. 
7.5. Employees in public safety, seasonal work, and/or emergency response categories may accumulate up to four hundred eighty hours (480 hours) and shall be paid for all hours worked above the maximum accrual. 
7.6. Compensatory time must be used within one year of accrual. The use of compensatory time off shall be requested two weeks in advance of the use of the time off. Approval of the request shall be contingent upon whether it will unduly disrupt the operation of the institutional unit. 
7.7. Should an individual's employment be terminated, any unused compensatory time shall be reimbursed as follows: 
7.7.1. The average regular rate received by such employee during the first three years of 
the employee's employment; or, 
7.7.2. The final regular rate received by such employee, whichever is higher. 
7.7.3. An employee may not work overtime unless approved in advance. 
16.8. Posting 
8.1. The College will post all classified positions both internally and externally in order to provide employees adequate time to make application for positions.
