1 Introduction
The research goal of study is to describe the funding system of higher education and its
impact on the overall development of higher education in Latvia. Special attention is paid to
the period prior to Latvia joined the European Union in 2004 as well as the most recent
changes.
Methods. The study is primarily based on qualitative research methods. Views of different
groups of stakeholders are analyzed on the basis of survey data, interviews and focus group
discussion results. The list of interviewees is presented in Appendix 1. A survey was per-
formed among the members of the Latvian Rectors’ Council and board of the Latvian Profes-
sors’ Association. 41 questionnaires were obtained including 34 from representatives of state
higher education institutions and 7 from private higher education institutions. 29 of the re-
spondents were rectors and vice rectors, nine were department heads and three professors.
A stakeholders in the study were grouped as follows: - Ministry of Finance and commercial
banks, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Economics, Ministry of Regional De-
velopment and Local Government; - Higher Education Council, Rectors’ Council; representa-
tives of employers; students. The views of these groups of stakeholders are reflected in this
study. Only in particular cases an individual opinion is cited. Analysis of legislative and policy
documents is performed as part of the study. Quantitative indicators are used to characterize
specific features of the funding system of higher education, as well as the interaction of this
system with the overall development of higher education.

Main Features of the Funding System of Higher Education
The Education Law [EL] passed in 1991 triggered radical changes in the development of
higher education in Latvia. It legitimized the democratization and decentralization of higher
education which was already underway. State budget funding was shifted to full-time studies
only and for students finishing their studies on a part-time basis. The Education Law enabled
studies for tuition fees and establishment of private institutions of higher education.
Financial resources and higher education funding procedures are defined by the Law on In-
stitutions of Higher Education [LIHE] (1995), the Education Law (1998) and other legislative
documents (see Appendix 2). The Law on Institutions of Higher Education says that “Institu-
tions of higher education shall be financed by the founders thereof. The founder of an institu-
tion of higher education shall provide financial resources and the control of the utilisation
thereof for the continuous operation of the institution of higher education, as well as for the
fulfilling of the tasks determined by the founder. The financial resources of State institutions
of higher education shall be formed from the resources of the State general budget, as well
- 2 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
as other income which institutions of higher education earn by performing activities for the
realisation of the aims specified in the constitutions thereof” (LIHE, Section 77 (1) ).
Funding of higher education study programs is directly linked to determined number of study
places. According to the Law on Institutions of Higher Education “The number of study
places to be financed from the funds of the State budget in an institution of higher education
shall be determined by the Minister for Education and Science on the basis of a proposal of
the Council of Higher Education. The number of study places in institutions of higher educa-
tion founded by local governments and other legal persons and natural persons shall be de-
termined by the founder of these institutions of higher education” (LIHE, Section 51).
According to the Law on Institutions of Higher Education, the Higher Education Council has
extensive competence and functions, including issues of funding the higher education. It has
the authority, for example, to formulate proposals for the improvement of higher education
and the study fee, to provide an opinion to the Minister for Education and Science and the
Cabinet regarding the draft State budget for the financing of institutions of higher education.
Twelve members of the Higher Education Council are the key stakeholders of the higher
education market. Membership of the Higher Education Council is confirmed by Parliament –
Saeima. The Higher Education Council’s resources to realize its mandate are limited, how-
ever.
Interviews with members of the Higher Education Council revealed inadequacies in existing
funding vis à vis real costs of study programs. Funding of technical, natural, and arts study
programs has for a long time been quite low and can be characterized as regressive. The
Latvian Science and Education Workers’ Trade Union representative in interview pointed out
that funding has been inadequate in those specializations that are necessary for develop-
ment of national economy, and since these needs have not been assessed the available
funding does not always reach its true goal. The Latvian Student Association representative
emphasized that there is no information about long term market demand.
The Education Law states that “for programmes of higher education, the State shall cover the
fees for the acquisition of education for a specified number of student positions in accor-
dance with the State procurement specified for the relevant year; for other student positions
each institution of higher education may determine the fees for the acquisition of education.
A student may receive State credit for studies in higher educational programmes. The ob-
tained credit shall be paid back or extinguished in accordance with the procedures pre-
scribed by the Cabinet. An alien or a stateless person shall pay for the acquisition of educa-
tion in accordance with a contract concluded with the relevant educational institution. For
citizens of European Union States and their children who acquire education in Latvia, the
fees for education shall be determined and covered in accordance with the same procedures
as for citizens and permanent residents of the Republic of Latvia” (EL, Section 12 (2-5) ).
Institutions of higher education are funded according to annual Law on State Budget. The
Ministry of Education and Science, other ministries and state institutions may sign contracts
- 3 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
with accredited state, municipal or private institutions of higher education for the training of
specialists in specific areas with appropriate funding.
The total amount of higher education funding increases annually (Figure 1). However, this
increase is a result of growth of non-budget resources (Figure 2). In 1995, revenues from
non-budget resources formed 21 per cent of total funding, but in 2005 these revenues sur-
passed budget funding and formed 59 per cent of total higher education funding (IZM, 2006).
Tuition fee revenues boomed during that period.
Case study. Annual competition for state funded study places (“rotation”)
Most state institutions of higher education have devised a system whereby a student who fulfils mini-
mum grade point requirements retains his state funded status for the entire length of his/her studies.
The University of Latvia, where 3⁄4 of the students pay tuition fees, has (upon recommendation of the
Student Council) since 2001 established a yearly competition for the state funded places, so called
“rotation”. All students at the same study year enrolled in the same study program take part in the
competition. The only criterion to succeed in competition is the student’s grade points in the past aca-
demic year. Academic achievement statistics for all students are computerized and stored so as to
ensure a fair competition. More than 15,000 students take part in the competition. As a result of the
competition only 7 – 10 per cent of the students change their source of funding, but the competition is
justified. Young people’s motivation to study has increased and students have become more demand-
ing of their lecturers. Significant advantage of this system is the fact that students paying tuition fee
see an opportunity to compete for state funded vacancies.
Initially institutions of higher education were funded based on detailed estimate documenta-
tion submitted to the Ministry of Education and Science, where each estimate entry was
carefully checked. Higher education policy and state budget funding principles were not pre-
cisely formulated in that time. After a comprehensive assessment of the situation in Latvian
higher education, OECD experts suggested the following (OECD, 2000):
improve the financing policy so as to ensure access to education to all students regardless of
social and economic status; define the percentage of study costs to be covered by tuition
costs; to promote student loans by offering interest rates and repayment terms that are stu-
dent-friendly; define clear and transparent selection criteria for students applying for state
funded vacancies; to increase finance and credit resources for those individuals returning to
university as a result of changes in the education and/or labour market; to promote coopera-
tion between universities and general secondary schools, professional and vocational
schools, non-governmental organizations and other institutions supporting educational re-
form.
Steps have been taken in subsequent years to realize these suggestions.
An important stage in the alignment of higher education funding started by the passing of
Cabinet of Ministers regulation Nr. 334: “Procedure for state funding of institutions of higher
education” (2001). Based on this regulation, a unified normative financing principle was im-
- 4 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
plemented in Latvia from the year 2002. Unfortunately, the norms do not include several im-
portant positional entries like funding of internet access. According to this regulation, the an-
nual funding of full-time studies is based on definite number of state funded study places for
each university (this number along with the number of graduates is affirmed by a contractual
agreement between rector and minister), basic cost per student and tuition cost coefficients
by study fields. The tuition cost coefficient in the master degree program is 1.5, but in the
doctoral program it is 3 times greater than the respective coefficient value in undergraduate
study program. State funding is not available for part-time studies.
The main features of the funding system of higher education in Latvia are:
 State budget funding forms the smallest part of income in many state institutions of higher
education. For example, the budget of the University of Latvia, the largest university in the
three Baltic countries, included only 29 per cent budgetary subsidy in 2005.
 Tuition fee revenues are significant in the financing of study programs in social sciences
and humanities. The institutions of higher education define tuition fees themselves, but
students have a free choice to choose an institution and study program.
 There are several state defined differences between state and private institutions of higher
education in the management of financial and other resources resulting in inequitable op-
erations of these institutions. Differences include accounting, real estate ownership, staff-
ing, purchasing procedures etc.
 State budget subsidy for research has been inadequate during the whole transition period
to market economy. Assigning of funds by National Research Council is characterized by
restrictions by research areas (certain areas receive no funding at all, like political sci-
ence). Corporate ties can play a role as well. The cooperative ties between universities
and the private business are inadequate and irregular. The researchers’ own personal ini-
tiative efforts are a key factor.
 After entering the European Union, the share of funding from the EU budget at the institu-
tions of higher education has increased radically.
One characteristic specific to the Latvian system of financing of higher education is the fact
that state funding is channelled through six ministries – Education and Science, Agriculture,
Health, Interior, Defence and Culture. This has both advantages and disadvantages. One
advantage is that the individual ministries have a say in implementation of new study pro-
grams, another is the opportunity for higher education institutions to receive additional fund-
ing from the individual ministries. A disadvantage is the fragmentation of institutional and
financial resources, which makes control and effective monitoring of financial resources more
difficult. In addition, institutions of higher education have inequitable access to state funding
because of the differences in financial resources between ministries.
The last 10 – 15 years have seen the onset of establishing regional institutions of higher
education and branch campuses of existing institutions of higher education throughout Lat-
via. Although the term ‘regional institution of higher education’ cannot be found in legislative
- 5 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
and normative documentation, it is used to designate any institution of higher education that
is not located in the capital city Riga. In the opinion of the Ministry of Education and Science
representative, municipalities should be encouraged to play a more active part in funding of
regional institutions of higher education and ensuring training of well-qualified human re-
sources for regional development. Individual municipalities do support their local institutions
of higher education. For example, Ventspils city council provides additional funding for
Ventspils University College. A tendency to open branch campuses in various cities in gen-
eral is viewed by interviewees as positive, but attention must be paid to quality assurance
there.
Based on the opinions of many stakeholders, there is lack of unified document describing the
funding strategy of higher education in Latvia. Funding issues is included as part of various
policies and planning documents, that are not always in agreement with each other. The
strategy also appears as part of budget redistribution among institutions of higher education,
study levels and programs.
2.2
Interrelationships Between the Funding System and Higher Education Pol-
icy
The growing demand for higher education since the mid-1990s has stimulated expansion
and diversification of the higher education system. The private sector, regional institutions of
higher education and branch campuses have all developed within the framework of this sys-
tem. A market economy demands more attention be focused on the quality of education,
which is largely connected with the amount of funding per student. Several ministry represen-
tatives noted in their interviews that higher education still inadequately responds to the de-
mands of the labour market and that there is a concern about the quality of education, espe-
cially in the natural sciences and engineering. These problems demand searching for effec-
tive resolution.
Representatives of the higher education system were asked the question: Is there a higher
education market in Latvia? In the opinion of government representatives, there is a market
of higher education, and Latvian institutions of higher education must be competitive in Euro-
pean and global educational space. The Study Foundation expert pointed out that there is a
market in the area of social sciences, where exist large supply and demand. Both state and
private institutions of higher education are competing here. By contrast, in the natural sci-
ences a market is practically nonexistent, because they require expensive infrastructure,
which private institutions of higher education cannot provide yet. A rector of private institution
of higher education said that in his opinion market exists as far as demand is concerned, but
on the supply side situation is more complicated – there is no free competition among the
institutions of higher education and legislation does not promote the development of a market
in this area.
- 6 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
The amendments to the Education Law enacted in 2001 proscribed that the Ministers’ Cabi-
net establish a unified national educational policy and strategy and submit an educational
development concept for the next four years to the Saeima for confirmation. The educational
development conception (confirmed in 2002 by KM regulation Nr. 383) sets the developmen-
tal goals of the educational system for the period from 2002 to 2005. This conception was
formulated taking into account guidelines set forth in Latvia’s long term economic strategy,
the National Development Plan and the National Employment Plan.
Much discussion has taken place in recent years about the system of financing higher educa-
tion in Latvia, because with growing numbers of students the ability of the state budget to
increase funding of higher education institutions has been rather limited. State budget fund-
ing of higher education as compared to the GDP has steadily decreased since the mid-1990s
(Figure 3). According to the Ministry of Education and Science, inadequacy of state budget
funding is the major problem of higher education. The state budget cannot adequately fi-
nance higher education in response to the growing demand. The part of GDP used for higher
education is comparable with other European countries, but the low level of GDP per capita
results in a low absolute level of funding of higher education. Thus, other resources are
searched.
The number of students continues to grow, mostly due to those paying tuition fees. During
the 2005/2006 academic year 23 per cent of students studied in groups financed from state
budget while 77 per cent paid tuition fee (IZM, 2006). Thus, tuition fee has become a signifi-
cant source of revenues for financing higher education. However, the tuition fee for full time
studies in many study programs at state institutions of higher education was set lower than
what the state budget pays per student, and a levelling of resources took place between
state funded and tuition vacancies.
In 2001 experts and politicians offered several suggestions to tackle a problem of higher
education funding, starting with the most liberal – switching to a total tuition fee system and
making study loans available to all students. With appropriate legislation and well-considered
study loan system this approach could work in Latvia as it has in other countries. The pro-
posed model proscribed that total funding of state institutions of higher education would
come at 85 per cent level of required funding according to the system of tuition cost coeffi-
cients in correspondence with the determined number of full-time study places with the re-
maining 15 per cent coming from tuition fees paid by students for specific study programs.
The advantage of such a model would be a balance between state and individual investment
in higher education as well as more equitable educational opportunities for all residents of
Latvia. This model, however, did not receive the support needed for a political decision, be-
cause the idea of raising tuition costs gained little support among society and the majority of
politicians.
The main goals of the higher education system and its funding are determined in the National
concept of development of higher education system and institutions of higher education for
- 7 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
the time period up to 2010, which was voted through by the CM committee in 2001. Among
the main goals set forth by the plan of development of funding system were:
 To develop a doctoral studies and review salary system in order to attract younger aca-
demic staff to academia;
 To achieve step by step optimal tuition costs;
 Guarantee the availability of study and student loans to anyone needing them;
 Review pertinent legislation to allow institutions of higher education to attract more funding
from the private sector.
It was planned to increase state budget funding of higher education by factor 1.7 in order to
achieve the above goals. This, however, realized only partially.
Representatives of the higher education system were interviewed if they felt that Latvia as a
small country had a specificity for higher education and it’s funding thereof. According to
government representatives the educational system of a small country is more flexible and it
should be able to respond more effectively to market changes. On the other hand, it is im-
possible for a small country to be able to provide all the science and engineering qualifica-
tions spectrum demanded by the national economy.
Tuition fees in Latvia are relatively high when compared with other western European coun-
tries. It is about 23 – 70% of the average yearly wage (CSB, 2005). For this reason many
households cannot afford the cost of a higher education. Lower tax rates and a study loan
system are two ways that this problem is being tackled.
Does the existing tax system stimulate the development of higher education?
The majority of interviews expressed the opinion that the existing system of taxation does not
have any significant effect on the development of the higher education system. 63 per cent of
principals of institutions of higher education also said that the tax system has no effect and it
does not promote attracting financial resources to higher education. Only 32 per cent of re-
spondents considered that the tax system does help and five per cent did not have an opin-
ion on this question. The fact that state budget scholarships are not subject to income tax
was appreciated.
The existing tax system does not stimulate the employer to get involved in the financing of
higher education because if they choose to pay tuition for an employee, they have to pay
corporate income tax. The only exception to this is engineering doctoral scholarships, in
which case the tuition cost is tax deductible. Interviewed representatives of commerce banks,
Chamber of trade and industry suggested that the tax deductible amount should be in-
creased and study loan interest rates be included in the amount to be reimbursed.
In the case of a private individual, the income tax law provides for compensation of education
and health care expenses in the amount of 150 Lats per taxation year. This was set by CM
- 8 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
regulation Nr. 336 (2001) “Regulation on justifiable expenses for education and health care”
and the amount has not changed in many years and is totally inadequate today. Tuition fees
set by institutions of higher education are considerably higher. In addition, interview re-
sponses expressed concern about the tremendous amount of bureaucracy required to get
reimbursed for even part of the tax paid.
Study and student loans. Pluses and minuses. Student loans, available since 1997, offer
students considerable financial support. They are meant to cover living expenses for full-time
students. In 1999 study loans became available for both full and part-time students enrolled
in state and private institutions of higher education (Figure 4). The mentioned loan system
was established to make higher education more universally available. Both types of loans are
available to all successful students enrolled in accredited study programs, including studies
abroad. The loan system is regulated by several CM regulations and it is administered by a
specially created entity – the Study Foundation.
Initially the state budget was the source for loans. In 2000 the Cabinet of Ministers approved
a conceptual decision to switch gradually to crediting by commercial banks. From September
1, 2001 commercial banks started to issue loans with state guarantees. According to this
new procedure, loans are granted and administered by commercial banks that are selected
annually in public auction based on total loan amount and interest rate offered. The banks
having thus gained the right to deal in student loans receive from state budget the difference
between the interest rate paid by students and the established interest rate. The overall lend-
ing strategy is based on replacing loan funds from the state budget by sources from lending
institutions, thus easing the uptight state budget. The amount of loans has increased radi-
cally during the last few years.
Loans can be discharged with state budget funds. Based on the Cabinet of Ministers regula-
tion Nr. 219 (2001) “Procedure for approval, granting, repayment and discharge of study
loans from state budget funds”, loans are discharged for the following categories of students:
 Students who upon graduation start working in their area of specialization (academic or
professional) in professions at public or municipal institutions approved annually by the
Cabinet of Ministers;
 Handicapped persons of first and second group;
 In the case of death of loan recipient.
In line with the Cabinet of Ministers regulation Nr. 445 (2001) “Procedure for approval, grant-
ing, repayment and discharge of student loans from state budget funds”, loans are dis-
charged the same as described above. In addition, a student who has a child during the lend-
ing or repayment period needs to repay 30 per cent of the loan.
In evaluating the existing loan system, the majority (55 – 56%) of interviewed respondents
expressed opinion that it is more in the interest of society than not. There is agreement
among the respondents regarding innovations in the student loan system – 59 per cent of
- 9 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
them are of the opinion that the student should be able to choose his lending bank, without
tying banks to specific institutions of higher education; 36 per cent feel that the overseeing of
student loans must be simplified striking universities from the loan administration process.
Only one respondent suggested granting non-guaranteed loans.
Along with the procedure for determining the number of state budget funded study places,
both the lending system and study/student loan discharge system is a significant tool in train-
ing specialists in areas vital for national economy and sectors of national importance. It was
emphasized in interviews that in this way higher education becomes more accessible, social
expenditures are eased, student becomes more disciplined and successful, and the loans
have low interest rates and favourable repayment terms.
Nevertheless, representatives from the banking sector, Study Foundation, Chamber of trade
and industry admitted that the present student loan system does have weaknesses. Three
parties (the institution of higher education, the Study Foundation and the bank) are involved
in the lending process, which inhibits effective information exchange and complicates the
loan procedure. Resource quotas for student loans are divided among the institutions of
higher education. Most of the institutions use the quotas, however, some do not. Only some
institutions of higher education request additional loan funding for their students. Upon enter-
ing the institution of higher education students cannot immediately apply for a study loan
although the first tuition payment is due upon enrolment. The process for securing state
guarantee is rather lengthy. Study loans often do not cover all of the tuition costs. Therefore
the difference must be paid by student. The loan discharge system is not altogether clear.
Several institutions of higher education have electronic data processing problems and banks
receive faulty information. Bank requirements to qualify for a loan are overly stringent (man-
datory co-signer, mandatory account at that bank, salary direct deposit to that account).
These requirements could be eased if banks had to directly compete for borrower rather than
being awarded the right to a one-year monopoly in the study loan business.
2.3
Changes to be Expected
Current legislative and normative changes in the funding and development of the higher edu-
cation are focusing on improvement of functioning system. This section of study gives posi-
tion expressed by representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education and
Science, Ministry of Economics and Ministry of Regional Development and Local Govern-
ment.
Improvement in the budget funding mechanism. In order to promote faster development
of higher education a transition from the minimal study cost coefficient values to optimal val-
ues must be ensured, raising the minimal coefficient value by one tenth every year. This
process must be implemented gradually over the ten years period in accordance with the
Cabinet of Ministers regulation Nr. 334. Simultaneous funding must be increased for re-
search and doctoral studies. Raising the coefficients is a painfully slow process due to re-
- 10 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
stricted budget resources. This is particularly deterring vis à vis the studies in natural sci-
ences and engineering whose coefficients are higher.
State institutions of higher education, taking into account solvency, often set tuition fees
lower than the cost of state budget funded vacancies . This is especially true in upper level
study programs with high cost coefficients. This creates quality assurance problems in the
studies covered by tuition fees and threats to redistribute budget funding from the state
funded places to tuition fee covered vacancies.
Considering the increase of research funding and the distribution of this funding by type of
institutions of higher education, it can be expected that institutions will more clearly define
their stance towards research activities. Obviously, some institutions of higher education will
place emphasis on their research institution status and will accent innovation and applied
research.
Corruption is noted as a significant problem in Latvia. Respondents among public administra-
tion and Higher Education Council representatives noted that corruption has not touched the
financing of higher education and due to the present complexities of the system, it is practi-
cally impossible to do so. Favouring one institution of higher education manifests itself more
or less as lobbying. Politicians and government officials have for the most part graduated
from the bigger institutions of higher education. The opinion that state institutions of higher
education have a strong informal effect on state administration and its officials – graduates of
these same institutions of higher education – is quite prevalent.
Demographic challenges. The number of students is expected to decrease over the next
years. It will be determined by the very low birth rate in the early 1990s, and partially by in-
creasing enrolment of other EU institutions of higher education. The contribution to institution
of higher education budgets from the inner education market may decrease for this reason.
Institutions of higher education will be forced to pay special attention to external markets in
an effort to attract foreign students (forming business alliances, developing affiliated pro-
grams, franchise type activities abroad, branch campuses etc.).
It is quite conceivable that the decline in the student numbers will force public authorities to
use budget funding more effectively. Competition among institutions of higher education,
including private institutions, for state budget funding could be promoted, the distribution
mechanism of budget funding has to be improved, too. That in turn will force the institutions
of higher education to improve their strategies. More importance will have to be placed on
being informed about demand of national economy, lobbying methods may have to be im-
proved, too (if a tender procedure for distribution of funding will be accepted). Marketing
methods will be used more and more and institutions of higher education will have to clearly
mark their role in the national and global higher education market, especially if the budget
funding model of “the money follows the student” will be realized and the student will be
given free choice to enrol any institution of higher education.
- 11 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
Development of research and doctoral studies. It is most likely that state budget funds for
graduate and post-graduate studies will continue to increase both in number of vacancies as
well as the funding per student. Some institutions of higher education will see an increase in
the state budget share of their respective budgets, which will result in more attention being
paid to the demands of the state. The Scientific Activity Law adopted in 2005 states that the
Cabinet of Ministers, when drafting and submitting its annual budget law to the Saeima, pro-
jects an annual increase in research funding no less than 0,15 per cent of the GDP until the
time that the total state subsidy reaches one per cent of the GDP (Latvijas Vestnesis, 2005).
The position of the Higher Education council states that the ratio between research and edu-
cation funding does not have to be the same in all institutions of higher education. Research
is traditionally funded less at private institutions of higher education, but academic staff from
state institutions of higher education supplement their ranks and ensure the study process.
The university status by definition means a pronounced emphasis on research, especially
fundamental research. Universities collaborate with and render assistance to academies and
other institutions of higher education which are more oriented to labour market needs and
are more involved in applied research.
Both EU funding and state budget financing of investment programs in higher education will
increase. It is conceivable that institutions of higher education will pay more attention to the
realization of the EU and national higher education policy statements.
The effect of the funding system on the accessibility of higher education. Only 38 per
cent of the representatives of institutions of higher education feel that the current system of
financing promotes accessibility of higher education. 37 per cent feel that it does not promote
accessibility at all, 20 per cent feel that it has no effect whatsoever, but 5 per cent of them
had no opinion on this question. To promote access to higher education, socio-economic
factors should be considered when distributing funding for students. In response to the ques-
tion “What should be considered in awarding state budget subsidy?” 33 per cent of the re-
spondents named family income, 15 per cent - social conditions in the family, 13 per cent -
student’s place of residence. Of the remaining 39 per cent, who named other factors, aca-
demic success and cost of study programs were mentioned most often. These are already
the main criteria for accepting students into university and for awarding state budget subsidy.
The efficiency of use of financial resources at state and private institutions of higher
education. Private institutions of higher education with the exception of the Higher School of
Social Work and Social Pedagogies “Attistiba” do not receive state budget funding. They are
functioning under the guidelines of commerce legislation. All state institutions of higher edu-
cation with the exception of the Banking College of Higher Education receive state budget
subsidy for education and also enrol students for a fee. Thus it is difficult to do a comparative
analysis of the performance of both types of institutions. In the opinion of most of the respon-
dents, the effectiveness issue should be addressed as a complex. There is less scientific
activity and its infrastructure for it at private institutions of higher education, but they are
- 12 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
rather effective in the study sector and tend to react to changes in market demand more
quickly than state institutions. The latter have less autonomy in resource management than
do private institutions.
Measures implemented to reach the goals of the Lisbon Strategy. In accordance with
EU economic policy and employment guidelines, in October 2005 the Cabinet of Ministers
accepted Latvia’s national Lisbon Program for 2005 – 2008. It points to the problems and
main areas of activity needed to implement the Lisbon Strategy in Latvia, as well as target
indicators. In order to assure completion of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, the gov-
ernment has formed a Lisbon Strategy Monitoring Council led by the Minister of Economy.
The Council also consists of ministers involved in the Lisbon Strategy realization, representa-
tives of the Saeima, municipalities and social partners. Ministries and other responsible insti-
tutions ensure completion of Latvia’s national Lisbon Program for 2005 – 2008 within the
assigned budget guidelines.
2.4
The Influence of the Higher Education Funding System on Institutional
Strategies
Main features of institutional strategies. The majority of institutions of higher education in
Latvia have formulated and confirmed their development strategies. Sometimes these docu-
ments are formulated as institutions’ management programs. The available development
strategy documents are not very extensive. They address the following main issues: 1) per-
sonnel development (attracting a new personnel, changes in the structure of academic staff,
development of personnel holding doctoral degrees); 2) curriculum development (develop-
ment of new study programs, compliance with labour market needs, regional and national
demands and global trends); 3) promotion of research activities (regional needs, attracting
funding from external sources, particularly from the EU research programs and funds, pro-
moting innovation); 4) infrastructural development (room repairs, search for new facilities,
study and research equipment, library development, information technology development
etc.).
The development of international collaboration is less significant in institutional strategies (a
student and staff mobility is mentioned, development of joint and double degree study pro-
grams, enrolment of foreign students), as well as development of institutional management
(democratization of decision making, structural improvements). Quantitative indicators like
share of research funding, number of students, and goal attainment criteria, responsibility for
goal attainment, appear in the strategies very rarely. Preparation of strategies and their reali-
zation process is not clearly described. The strategies characteristically refrain from serious
use of marketing. The target market is seldom emphasized, nor is pricing, increasing market
opportunities etc.
The formation of institutional strategies and influential factors involved. The strategic
development document is usually the institution’s management program or guidelines for its
- 13 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
activities. Administrative departments, collegial governing bodies, representatives from aca-
demic staff and heads of academic divisions are involved in preparation of strategy as well.
Stakeholders (public and private sector employers, representatives from non-governmental
organizations, students and graduates) are rarely involved in preparatory process. Usually
they are involved in discussions about already formulated guidelines.
The opinion that the rector should be the key person involved in forming a university strategy
is dominant. In many cases the strategy is defined by the rector’s pre-election program,
which is more or less formulated by the individual candidate. In cases when the university
strategy is confirmed by the senate or another governing body, the rector’s role in the proc-
ess is prominent.
The formulation of institutional strategies is not described in any other managerial documents
therefore it is not easy to describe a list of determinants forming strategy. However, based on
strategy content, in our opinion, the most important elements of a strategy are: 1) analysis of
the present situation at the institution of higher education – personnel, resource analysis,
institutional traditions, market position assessment etc.; 2) relative advantages of the institu-
tion in the near future – a statement of students’ demands, its determinants and trends,
changes in the offer study programs, staff involvement in research; 3) opinion of the admini-
stration regarding priority development directions and institutional management policy.
The relationship between the funding system and institutional strategies. Institutional
strategies have, for the most part, developed due to the existing system of funding. Within
this context they can be characterized by:
 Emphasis on the role of the study process. The long term shortage of research funding
has forced institutions of higher education to focus more on income from tuition fees and
other sources in large part dependent from educational activities of the institution;
 Emphasis on compliance with national educational market demands rather than global or
EU market demands. This is due to the fact that the educational market provides the ma-
jor part of the budget of the institution of higher education. Some institutions of higher
education perceive all of Latvia as their market, for others it is a specific region;
 Less emphasis on the need to attract state budget funding for specific programs. Institu-
tions of higher education tend to rely on their own revenues and infrastructure;
 Little attention paid to foreign markets, enrolment of foreign students. The portion of reve-
nues earned from foreign students is small. A deterring factor in this regard is the national
policy towards foreign students, which has been very stringent;
 Increased emphasis on attracting EU funding. During the last two years we have seen that
EU funding is available for refurbishing the studies and research infrastructure, curriculum
development etc. This is why institutions of higher education are interested and have
started to emphasize this in their strategy documents.
- 14 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
A chronological assessment of institutional strategies brings us to the conclusion that their
formulation has been effected by changes in the funding system. For example, the strategies
formulated during the mid 1990s placed less emphasis on education market factors and the
development of research was hardly ever mentioned.
The funding system of higher education institutions and course for its improvement.
54 per cent of principals of higher education institutions consider the present system of fi-
nancing as unsatisfactory, 41 per cent rate it as satisfactory, but needing significant im-
provements. Only 5 per cent of the respondents feel that the present system does not need
any improvements.
There is no consensus among the leadership of Latvia’s institutions of higher education re-
garding the most appropriate system of higher education funding from the state budget. 42
per cent of the respondents feel that the state should continue to allocate budget subsidy
according to determined student numbers, 27 per cent feel that funding should follow the
student and 23 per cent believe that institutions of higher education should be funded based
on outcomes. All the private university administrators believe that funding should follow stu-
dents, who choose in which institution to study. Only eight respondents feel that the state
should not fund higher education institutions at all, but all students should pay tuition fees
and apply for study loans.
Nor is there any consensus regarding the most effective distribution of state funding. 24 per
cent of the respondents feel that fewer students should receive state financing, but the fund-
ing per student should be increased. 14 per cent of the respondents feel that more students
should receive state budget funding, 21 per cent feel that the number and diversity of educa-
tional institutions should be reduced, but 7 per cent feel that the above should be increased.
34 per cent of the respondents suggest their own solution to the problem: increase of funding
(most often mentioned), provide equitable support for regional institutions of higher educa-
tion, finance higher education based on priorities set forth in the national development plan,
finance institutions based on results or academic success indicators. 4/5 of private university
administrators feel that the funding per student should be increased.
Institutional Foundations. Based on their strategic guidelines and existing legislation, insti-
tutions of higher education are establishing foundations and agencies in order to gain more
autonomy in dealing with their resources and to separate them from state funds, which are
controlled by the state. According to the ministries, this is simply an attempt to circumvent
bureaucracy and gain additional funding to distribute as institutions see it. In the opinion of
the Chamber of trade and industry representatives, institutions of higher education are at-
tempting to solve the problems of financial flow, which are caused by legal restrictions and
liens. Business representatives admit that foundations do somewhat help to resolve the is-
sues of current funding model. According to the representative from the Ministry of Econom-
ics: “If foundations are closely monitored and the utilization of funds occurs in compliance
with the goals of the university, they help promote the development of higher education and
- 15 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
results in more effective use of state funding for public institutions of higher education. The
amount of cash flow in institutional foundations is small, however, and does not significantly
affect the funding system of higher education. Foundations are not the solution to the prob-
lem of inadequate funding”.

2.5.1
Strengths and Weaknesses of the Funding System and Development of
Higher Education: a Summary of the Stakeholders’ Opinions
Strengths
Higher education is traditionally very highly valued in society. The largest state institutions of
higher education are very prestigious. The number of students per 1000 inhabitants has in-
creased steadily since the mid-1990s and now it is among the highest in the EU and the
world. In 2005 the number of students per 1000 inhabitants was 562 (IZM, 2006). Political
understanding of the significance of higher education has increased. Latvia has entirely be-
come part of the European higher education space.
The number of institutions of higher education has increased since 1991. The private institu-
tions (which mainly focus on the social sciences) and regional institutions of higher education
have been established. The network of branch campuses is developing throughout the coun-
try. Along with growing competitiveness among the institutions, new and more diverse study
programs are being offered, including evening and weekend programs for working students,
correspondence courses, e-courses. The government has set the development of programs
in engineering and the natural sciences as its priorities.
The funding system of higher education institution is continuously being improved. Given
insufficient state budget funding, the tuition fee system is developing at both state and private
institutions of higher education, making higher education more accessible. Tuition fees are
subject to tax advantages as well.
A comprehensive study and student loan program has been established. Graduates of higher
education institutions can apply to have their loan discharged from state budget. Scholar-
ships awarded by the state have become bigger.
In recent years institutions of higher education have successfully attracted more EU financ-
ing, state budget funding for research and development has increased.
2.5.2
Weaknesses
The governmental decision to increase funding of higher education by 10 per cent annually
has not been realized. Inadequate investment has been made in the development of infra-
structure, expanding library resources, the share of investments in total expenditure is low.
Research funding in the institutions of higher education still was inadequate. The current
- 16 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
system of awarding state budget subsidy does not encourage institutions to improve quality
assurance, because the funding is not results oriented.
State and private institutions of HE operate under inequitable competitive conditions.
The collaboration between institutions of higher education, employers and professional asso-
ciations is weak. Study programs often are superficial and general, competencies and skills
gained do not correspond fully to the demands of the labour market. Study programs tend to
be quite fragmented (more than 500 programs have been registered), which does not en-
courage consolidation of academic personnel and development of research.
The extensive technology and investment programs have disappeared due to inadequate
investment in their development.
Existing legislation does not encourage the participation of the employers in the funding of
education of their factual and potential future employees. These include paying students’
tuition, discharging student loans, scholarship support and others.
The distribution of budgetary funds among institutes of higher education and thematic groups
of study programs takes place based on criteria that are not rather clear and understandable
fro all players in the educational market. Future long term demands for definite specialists
have not been clearly identified. Students are restricted in their choice of study direction and
institution, because opportunities to compete for state budget funded vacancies are inequita-
ble. For this reason, the choice of study field is often made based on financial considerations
rather than interest or ability. The distribution of students by type of study program is rather
disproportionate (every second student is in the social sciences).
Different conditions of managing financial resources in the state and private institutions of
higher education. Private schools comply with commercial legislation while management of
financial resources, including tuition fees, in state institutions are regulated by more strict
provisions of budget institutions. Cross-subsidization between budget funded and tuition fee
funded studies, between different level and type of study programs still exist in educational
establishments.
The number of students per faculty is disproportionately high (30 students per faculty mem-
ber in Latvia, 15 students per faculty member in OECD countries). Extremely high is students
to professors ratio - there are 100 students per professor in Latvia. Academic personnel are
aging and qualified young replacements are sorely lacking.
Study loans for the most part do not completely cover the tuition costs. There is no direct
contact between the bank and the institution of higher education, which delays the lending
process. This is especially important for first year students, who have to personally pay the
tuition costs at the beginning of studies. Students are not allowed to choose a bank of their
choice for a loan; the loan discharge system is not clear enough.
- 17 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
Social factors such as family income are not taken into consideration when awarding funding
(including scholarships), which limits access of poorer students to higher education. The pro-
portion of students working parallel to their studies is very high.
There is a relatively low salary differentiation based on level of education and obtained quali-
fication, resulting in lack of motivation to continue schooling beyond the secondary level.
Graduates of specific programs (teachers, for example) are not motivated to work in their
specialty due to the inadequate salary level.
There has been a very small increase in the number of state budget subsidized study
places. Therefore proportion of state budget funded students in the total student population is
declining. There is practically no competition among the candidates to tuition fee covered
study vacancies; in reality anyone able to pay is accepted. This is a threat to the quality of
education. The dropout rate is considerable. The number of doctoral students and doctoral
degree recipients is low (0.4 per cent of total number of graduates in all cycles of higher edu-
cation).
3 Conclusions
Interviews and discussions with stakeholders as well as analysis of statistics, policy docu-
ments and legislation lead us to the following conclusions about the funding and its effect on
the development of higher education in Latvia:
 The rapid growth of the higher education sector in Latvia became possible due to growing
demand for higher education, the increase in number and type of educational facilities, in-
cluding private and regional institutions of higher education, and tuition fee programs. All
of these factors contributed to the formation of a higher education market. State and pri-
vate institutions activity in this market stimulates the development of the higher education
system.
 Introduction of a tuition fee system has made higher education more accessible. A signifi-
cant turning point in the development of higher education is the establishment of a study
and a student loan program. The lending process, however, must be simplified. Loan ad-
ministration functions should in fact be removed from the institutions of higher education
and delegated to the Study Foundation. Loan amount quotas should be divided not
among institutions, but rather among nationally significant study areas.
 The mechanism of normative allocation of state budget subsidy at institutions of higher
education has resulted in a more stable academic development planning. However, there
is no guarantee of special normative compliance with real needs of educational institu-
tions, especially in the field of modern technologies. Increased state budget funding in the
higher education sector would make create opportunity to increase number of graduate
- 18 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
and post-graduate students. The continued growth in the number of students is seriously
threatened in the near future by the decline of fertility.
 Different conditions of competition exist for state and private institutions of higher educa-
tion. All players in the market should have to comply with the same rules regarding man-
aging of financial resources, asset management, language of instruction and rights to
claim for state budget subsidy.
 The existing tax system does not promote involvement of businesses sector to support the
higher education system, making it difficult for an employer to invest in the education of
his employees, nor does it facilitate collaboration in education and research with institu-
tions of higher education. All business transacted with institutions of higher education re-
lated to training or research should qualify for tax advantages.
 The Ministry of Education and Science supervise most of the institutions of higher educa-
tion in Latvia. A transparent resource allocation system regarding higher education devel-
opment for all ministries is lacking. It is recommended to establish competition procedures
to ensure more transparency of funding activities.
 The higher education funding system directly affects the institutional strategies. Market
concerns are dominating more and more in strategic documents. Recently more emphasis
is being placed on attracting funds via research and other projects.
 Some institutions of higher education have established foundations in order to attract ad-
ditional funding. However, the results are less than satisfactory. Deterring factors include
lack of experience in fundraising and a resistance to donating, both on the part of society
as well as legislators.
 The existing criteria and system of state budget allocation among institutions of higher
education is not transparent enough. State funds support the most talented among stu-
dents, but do not stimulate a greater access to higher education among the nations poor.
