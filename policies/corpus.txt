outcomes/
Performance funding policies in higher education have had little
effect on student outcomes.
Performance and cost efficiency concerns have taken center stage in discussions about the
funding and oversight of public universities in recent years. One of the primary manifestations of
these concerns is the rise of performance funding policies, or policies that seek to directly link
state appropriations to the outcomes institutions generate for students. In a study of over 500 four
year post-secondary institutions in all fifty states from 1993-2010, Amanda Rutherford and
Thomas Rabovsky find that current performance funding policies are not associated with higher
levels of student performance and that these policies may in fact contribute to lower performance
over a longer period of time. However, more recent policies linked to institutional base funding
may produce some likelihood of long-term improvement and require additional attention by
scholars and policymakers.
Historically, oversight of higher education has been oriented toward regulating inputs and
procedures, but over the last few decades policymakers have increasingly demanded that
universities be held accountable for their performance, particularly with respect to undergraduate
student outcomes. The average public four-year college in the United States graduates less than
60 percent of its students in six years, and graduation rates for many racial/ethnic minority groups are much lower.
As student outcomes have continued to lag at public colleges and universities, there has been a significant shift in
the way that many people think about the need for accountability and transparency with regard to higher
education.
Performance funding, initially adopted in 1979 by Tennessee, became increasingly popular during the 1990s as a
number of states began to implement a wide range of results-oriented reforms. When states felt the impact of a
series of economic recessions during the mid-2000s, performance funding (which often centered on awarding
bonus funding) waned in popularity, and several states dropped the performance component of their funding
criteria. In the last few years, however, these policies have reemerged, largely due to the efforts of reform-oriented
organizations such as Complete College America and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (see Figure 1
below).
Figure 1 – Performance funding policies for 4-year Universities (1979-2010)At the center of calls for accountability are normative debates about the proper role of quantifiable data about
institutional performance and the appropriateness of various approaches for measuring and tracking student
success. Recent performance funding policies have been quite controversial. Proponents claim that funding
incentives will spur increased performance by providing universities with stronger incentives to focus on and
improve student outcomes. Critics, however, worry that these initiatives will negatively impact academic quality
and rigor, that they might stifle efforts to improve diversity and provide broad access, or that they may simply be
ineffective and divert attention and resources away from other reforms that would be more effective.
Studying U.S. postsecondary institutions across 18 years, we find that performance funding policies are generally
unrelated to graduation rates. Further, the length of time a performance funding policy has been in place may
actually cause additional declines in graduate rates–.016 percentage points per year on average. Additional
analyses show the same negative trend for retention rates and degree production.
We then tested whether different types of performance funding policies have similar effects on student
performance. Older “performance funding 1.0” policies (PF 1.0) can differ dramatically from newer “performance
funding 2.0” reforms (PF 2.0). For instance, many PF 2.0 policies focus on intermediate indicators of campus
performance (throughput), rather than output/outcome indicators. In theory, this should provide policy-makers and
campus officials with more actionable and relevant information about performance, which can then be used to
inform new programs or to improve existing approaches. Because 2.0 policies are designed to be more
comprehensive and substantive than the older 1.0 policies, some have argued that PF 2.0 policies will be more
effective.
Our results provide some support for this logic. Analyses show that the negative relationship between
performance funding and graduation rates exists for 1.0 policies only. Although not significant, the coefficients for
2.0 policies are positive (see the predicted probabilities in Figure 2 below). While many 2.0 policies have only
been in place for a few years, it may be that 2.0 policies have evolved enough from 1.0 policies to have some
effectiveness in prompting colleges and universities to improve student performance. Performance 1.0 and 2.0
policies have little effect on retention rates, but do have interesting dynamics in the case of degree production.
Though substantively small, 1.0 policies appear to negatively affect performance over time while 2.0 policies may
improve performance over time.
Figure 2 – Average effect of performance funding policies on graduation ratesPerformance funding policies in place between 1993 and 2010 appear to have very little direct effect on student
outcomes, despite the expectation that institutions will react to funding incentives by prioritizing student success.
These findings illustrate that student outcomes are not enhanced by performance funding policies. Moreover,
student outcomes may even decline following the adoption of these policies. At best, these policies are ineffective,
and, at worst, they are negatively linked to student performance. However, performance 2.0 policies may provide
some hope that policies linked to institutional base funding may produce long-term improvement. Although a
positive relationship was detected for only one performance indicator and was small in size, it is possible that the
incentive structures of 2.0 policies are effective in gradually increasing student performance if these policies
continue over time.
The rise of PF 2.0 policies may provide useful insights for those hoping to design effective accountability regimes
in other policy areas. Because PF 2.0 policies involve larger percentages of base funding, they are likely to attract
more attention from administrators. Similarly, as it has become more apparent that performance funding policies
are spreading to more states and are likely to be in place for the foreseeable future, institutions may be less likely
to discount the commitment of policy-makers to performance funding and may be more likely to respond to
performance goals. This view suggests that strong financial incentives, combined with long-term stability, are the
most important elements of effective accountability policies. An alternative interpretation, however, might focus on
the fact that these newer policies also often use intermediate outcomes and take a more comprehensive view of
performance assessment. Thus, issues of policy design related to the relevance and perceived legitimacy of
performance data, as opposed to stronger financial incentives, may be critical in creating conditions that enable
effective performance management.

1 Introduction
The research goal of study is to describe the funding system of higher education and its
impact on the overall development of higher education in Latvia. Special attention is paid to
the period prior to Latvia joined the European Union in 2004 as well as the most recent
changes.
Methods. The study is primarily based on qualitative research methods. Views of different
groups of stakeholders are analyzed on the basis of survey data, interviews and focus group
discussion results. The list of interviewees is presented in Appendix 1. A survey was per-
formed among the members of the Latvian Rectors’ Council and board of the Latvian Profes-
sors’ Association. 41 questionnaires were obtained including 34 from representatives of state
higher education institutions and 7 from private higher education institutions. 29 of the re-
spondents were rectors and vice rectors, nine were department heads and three professors.
A stakeholders in the study were grouped as follows: - Ministry of Finance and commercial
banks, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Economics, Ministry of Regional De-
velopment and Local Government; - Higher Education Council, Rectors’ Council; representa-
tives of employers; students. The views of these groups of stakeholders are reflected in this
study. Only in particular cases an individual opinion is cited. Analysis of legislative and policy
documents is performed as part of the study. Quantitative indicators are used to characterize
specific features of the funding system of higher education, as well as the interaction of this
system with the overall development of higher education.

2.1
Main Features of the Funding System of Higher Education
The Education Law [EL] passed in 1991 triggered radical changes in the development of
higher education in Latvia. It legitimized the democratization and decentralization of higher
education which was already underway. State budget funding was shifted to full-time studies
only and for students finishing their studies on a part-time basis. The Education Law enabled
studies for tuition fees and establishment of private institutions of higher education.
Financial resources and higher education funding procedures are defined by the Law on In-
stitutions of Higher Education [LIHE] (1995), the Education Law (1998) and other legislative
documents (see Appendix 2). The Law on Institutions of Higher Education says that “Institu-
tions of higher education shall be financed by the founders thereof. The founder of an institu-
tion of higher education shall provide financial resources and the control of the utilisation
thereof for the continuous operation of the institution of higher education, as well as for the
fulfilling of the tasks determined by the founder. The financial resources of State institutions
of higher education shall be formed from the resources of the State general budget, as well
- 2 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
as other income which institutions of higher education earn by performing activities for the
realisation of the aims specified in the constitutions thereof” (LIHE, Section 77 (1) ).
Funding of higher education study programs is directly linked to determined number of study
places. According to the Law on Institutions of Higher Education “The number of study
places to be financed from the funds of the State budget in an institution of higher education
shall be determined by the Minister for Education and Science on the basis of a proposal of
the Council of Higher Education. The number of study places in institutions of higher educa-
tion founded by local governments and other legal persons and natural persons shall be de-
termined by the founder of these institutions of higher education” (LIHE, Section 51).
According to the Law on Institutions of Higher Education, the Higher Education Council has
extensive competence and functions, including issues of funding the higher education. It has
the authority, for example, to formulate proposals for the improvement of higher education
and the study fee, to provide an opinion to the Minister for Education and Science and the
Cabinet regarding the draft State budget for the financing of institutions of higher education.
Twelve members of the Higher Education Council are the key stakeholders of the higher
education market. Membership of the Higher Education Council is confirmed by Parliament –
Saeima. The Higher Education Council’s resources to realize its mandate are limited, how-
ever.
Interviews with members of the Higher Education Council revealed inadequacies in existing
funding vis à vis real costs of study programs. Funding of technical, natural, and arts study
programs has for a long time been quite low and can be characterized as regressive. The
Latvian Science and Education Workers’ Trade Union representative in interview pointed out
that funding has been inadequate in those specializations that are necessary for develop-
ment of national economy, and since these needs have not been assessed the available
funding does not always reach its true goal. The Latvian Student Association representative
emphasized that there is no information about long term market demand.
The Education Law states that “for programmes of higher education, the State shall cover the
fees for the acquisition of education for a specified number of student positions in accor-
dance with the State procurement specified for the relevant year; for other student positions
each institution of higher education may determine the fees for the acquisition of education.
A student may receive State credit for studies in higher educational programmes. The ob-
tained credit shall be paid back or extinguished in accordance with the procedures pre-
scribed by the Cabinet. An alien or a stateless person shall pay for the acquisition of educa-
tion in accordance with a contract concluded with the relevant educational institution. For
citizens of European Union States and their children who acquire education in Latvia, the
fees for education shall be determined and covered in accordance with the same procedures
as for citizens and permanent residents of the Republic of Latvia” (EL, Section 12 (2-5) ).
Institutions of higher education are funded according to annual Law on State Budget. The
Ministry of Education and Science, other ministries and state institutions may sign contracts
- 3 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
with accredited state, municipal or private institutions of higher education for the training of
specialists in specific areas with appropriate funding.
The total amount of higher education funding increases annually (Figure 1). However, this
increase is a result of growth of non-budget resources (Figure 2). In 1995, revenues from
non-budget resources formed 21 per cent of total funding, but in 2005 these revenues sur-
passed budget funding and formed 59 per cent of total higher education funding (IZM, 2006).
Tuition fee revenues boomed during that period.
Case study. Annual competition for state funded study places (“rotation”)
Most state institutions of higher education have devised a system whereby a student who fulfils mini-
mum grade point requirements retains his state funded status for the entire length of his/her studies.
The University of Latvia, where 3⁄4 of the students pay tuition fees, has (upon recommendation of the
Student Council) since 2001 established a yearly competition for the state funded places, so called
“rotation”. All students at the same study year enrolled in the same study program take part in the
competition. The only criterion to succeed in competition is the student’s grade points in the past aca-
demic year. Academic achievement statistics for all students are computerized and stored so as to
ensure a fair competition. More than 15,000 students take part in the competition. As a result of the
competition only 7 – 10 per cent of the students change their source of funding, but the competition is
justified. Young people’s motivation to study has increased and students have become more demand-
ing of their lecturers. Significant advantage of this system is the fact that students paying tuition fee
see an opportunity to compete for state funded vacancies.
Initially institutions of higher education were funded based on detailed estimate documenta-
tion submitted to the Ministry of Education and Science, where each estimate entry was
carefully checked. Higher education policy and state budget funding principles were not pre-
cisely formulated in that time. After a comprehensive assessment of the situation in Latvian
higher education, OECD experts suggested the following (OECD, 2000):
improve the financing policy so as to ensure access to education to all students regardless of
social and economic status; define the percentage of study costs to be covered by tuition
costs; to promote student loans by offering interest rates and repayment terms that are stu-
dent-friendly; define clear and transparent selection criteria for students applying for state
funded vacancies; to increase finance and credit resources for those individuals returning to
university as a result of changes in the education and/or labour market; to promote coopera-
tion between universities and general secondary schools, professional and vocational
schools, non-governmental organizations and other institutions supporting educational re-
form.
Steps have been taken in subsequent years to realize these suggestions.
An important stage in the alignment of higher education funding started by the passing of
Cabinet of Ministers regulation Nr. 334: “Procedure for state funding of institutions of higher
education” (2001). Based on this regulation, a unified normative financing principle was im-
- 4 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
plemented in Latvia from the year 2002. Unfortunately, the norms do not include several im-
portant positional entries like funding of internet access. According to this regulation, the an-
nual funding of full-time studies is based on definite number of state funded study places for
each university (this number along with the number of graduates is affirmed by a contractual
agreement between rector and minister), basic cost per student and tuition cost coefficients
by study fields. The tuition cost coefficient in the master degree program is 1.5, but in the
doctoral program it is 3 times greater than the respective coefficient value in undergraduate
study program. State funding is not available for part-time studies.
The main features of the funding system of higher education in Latvia are:
 State budget funding forms the smallest part of income in many state institutions of higher
education. For example, the budget of the University of Latvia, the largest university in the
three Baltic countries, included only 29 per cent budgetary subsidy in 2005.
 Tuition fee revenues are significant in the financing of study programs in social sciences
and humanities. The institutions of higher education define tuition fees themselves, but
students have a free choice to choose an institution and study program.
 There are several state defined differences between state and private institutions of higher
education in the management of financial and other resources resulting in inequitable op-
erations of these institutions. Differences include accounting, real estate ownership, staff-
ing, purchasing procedures etc.
 State budget subsidy for research has been inadequate during the whole transition period
to market economy. Assigning of funds by National Research Council is characterized by
restrictions by research areas (certain areas receive no funding at all, like political sci-
ence). Corporate ties can play a role as well. The cooperative ties between universities
and the private business are inadequate and irregular. The researchers’ own personal ini-
tiative efforts are a key factor.
 After entering the European Union, the share of funding from the EU budget at the institu-
tions of higher education has increased radically.
One characteristic specific to the Latvian system of financing of higher education is the fact
that state funding is channelled through six ministries – Education and Science, Agriculture,
Health, Interior, Defence and Culture. This has both advantages and disadvantages. One
advantage is that the individual ministries have a say in implementation of new study pro-
grams, another is the opportunity for higher education institutions to receive additional fund-
ing from the individual ministries. A disadvantage is the fragmentation of institutional and
financial resources, which makes control and effective monitoring of financial resources more
difficult. In addition, institutions of higher education have inequitable access to state funding
because of the differences in financial resources between ministries.
The last 10 – 15 years have seen the onset of establishing regional institutions of higher
education and branch campuses of existing institutions of higher education throughout Lat-
via. Although the term ‘regional institution of higher education’ cannot be found in legislative
- 5 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
and normative documentation, it is used to designate any institution of higher education that
is not located in the capital city Riga. In the opinion of the Ministry of Education and Science
representative, municipalities should be encouraged to play a more active part in funding of
regional institutions of higher education and ensuring training of well-qualified human re-
sources for regional development. Individual municipalities do support their local institutions
of higher education. For example, Ventspils city council provides additional funding for
Ventspils University College. A tendency to open branch campuses in various cities in gen-
eral is viewed by interviewees as positive, but attention must be paid to quality assurance
there.
Based on the opinions of many stakeholders, there is lack of unified document describing the
funding strategy of higher education in Latvia. Funding issues is included as part of various
policies and planning documents, that are not always in agreement with each other. The
strategy also appears as part of budget redistribution among institutions of higher education,
study levels and programs.
2.2
Interrelationships Between the Funding System and Higher Education Pol-
icy
The growing demand for higher education since the mid-1990s has stimulated expansion
and diversification of the higher education system. The private sector, regional institutions of
higher education and branch campuses have all developed within the framework of this sys-
tem. A market economy demands more attention be focused on the quality of education,
which is largely connected with the amount of funding per student. Several ministry represen-
tatives noted in their interviews that higher education still inadequately responds to the de-
mands of the labour market and that there is a concern about the quality of education, espe-
cially in the natural sciences and engineering. These problems demand searching for effec-
tive resolution.
Representatives of the higher education system were asked the question: Is there a higher
education market in Latvia? In the opinion of government representatives, there is a market
of higher education, and Latvian institutions of higher education must be competitive in Euro-
pean and global educational space. The Study Foundation expert pointed out that there is a
market in the area of social sciences, where exist large supply and demand. Both state and
private institutions of higher education are competing here. By contrast, in the natural sci-
ences a market is practically nonexistent, because they require expensive infrastructure,
which private institutions of higher education cannot provide yet. A rector of private institution
of higher education said that in his opinion market exists as far as demand is concerned, but
on the supply side situation is more complicated – there is no free competition among the
institutions of higher education and legislation does not promote the development of a market
in this area.
- 6 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
The amendments to the Education Law enacted in 2001 proscribed that the Ministers’ Cabi-
net establish a unified national educational policy and strategy and submit an educational
development concept for the next four years to the Saeima for confirmation. The educational
development conception (confirmed in 2002 by KM regulation Nr. 383) sets the developmen-
tal goals of the educational system for the period from 2002 to 2005. This conception was
formulated taking into account guidelines set forth in Latvia’s long term economic strategy,
the National Development Plan and the National Employment Plan.
Much discussion has taken place in recent years about the system of financing higher educa-
tion in Latvia, because with growing numbers of students the ability of the state budget to
increase funding of higher education institutions has been rather limited. State budget fund-
ing of higher education as compared to the GDP has steadily decreased since the mid-1990s
(Figure 3). According to the Ministry of Education and Science, inadequacy of state budget
funding is the major problem of higher education. The state budget cannot adequately fi-
nance higher education in response to the growing demand. The part of GDP used for higher
education is comparable with other European countries, but the low level of GDP per capita
results in a low absolute level of funding of higher education. Thus, other resources are
searched.
The number of students continues to grow, mostly due to those paying tuition fees. During
the 2005/2006 academic year 23 per cent of students studied in groups financed from state
budget while 77 per cent paid tuition fee (IZM, 2006). Thus, tuition fee has become a signifi-
cant source of revenues for financing higher education. However, the tuition fee for full time
studies in many study programs at state institutions of higher education was set lower than
what the state budget pays per student, and a levelling of resources took place between
state funded and tuition vacancies.
In 2001 experts and politicians offered several suggestions to tackle a problem of higher
education funding, starting with the most liberal – switching to a total tuition fee system and
making study loans available to all students. With appropriate legislation and well-considered
study loan system this approach could work in Latvia as it has in other countries. The pro-
posed model proscribed that total funding of state institutions of higher education would
come at 85 per cent level of required funding according to the system of tuition cost coeffi-
cients in correspondence with the determined number of full-time study places with the re-
maining 15 per cent coming from tuition fees paid by students for specific study programs.
The advantage of such a model would be a balance between state and individual investment
in higher education as well as more equitable educational opportunities for all residents of
Latvia. This model, however, did not receive the support needed for a political decision, be-
cause the idea of raising tuition costs gained little support among society and the majority of
politicians.
The main goals of the higher education system and its funding are determined in the National
concept of development of higher education system and institutions of higher education for
- 7 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
the time period up to 2010, which was voted through by the CM committee in 2001. Among
the main goals set forth by the plan of development of funding system were:
 To develop a doctoral studies and review salary system in order to attract younger aca-
demic staff to academia;
 To achieve step by step optimal tuition costs;
 Guarantee the availability of study and student loans to anyone needing them;
 Review pertinent legislation to allow institutions of higher education to attract more funding
from the private sector.
It was planned to increase state budget funding of higher education by factor 1.7 in order to
achieve the above goals. This, however, realized only partially.
Representatives of the higher education system were interviewed if they felt that Latvia as a
small country had a specificity for higher education and it’s funding thereof. According to
government representatives the educational system of a small country is more flexible and it
should be able to respond more effectively to market changes. On the other hand, it is im-
possible for a small country to be able to provide all the science and engineering qualifica-
tions spectrum demanded by the national economy.
Tuition fees in Latvia are relatively high when compared with other western European coun-
tries. It is about 23 – 70% of the average yearly wage (CSB, 2005). For this reason many
households cannot afford the cost of a higher education. Lower tax rates and a study loan
system are two ways that this problem is being tackled.
Does the existing tax system stimulate the development of higher education?
The majority of interviews expressed the opinion that the existing system of taxation does not
have any significant effect on the development of the higher education system. 63 per cent of
principals of institutions of higher education also said that the tax system has no effect and it
does not promote attracting financial resources to higher education. Only 32 per cent of re-
spondents considered that the tax system does help and five per cent did not have an opin-
ion on this question. The fact that state budget scholarships are not subject to income tax
was appreciated.
The existing tax system does not stimulate the employer to get involved in the financing of
higher education because if they choose to pay tuition for an employee, they have to pay
corporate income tax. The only exception to this is engineering doctoral scholarships, in
which case the tuition cost is tax deductible. Interviewed representatives of commerce banks,
Chamber of trade and industry suggested that the tax deductible amount should be in-
creased and study loan interest rates be included in the amount to be reimbursed.
In the case of a private individual, the income tax law provides for compensation of education
and health care expenses in the amount of 150 Lats per taxation year. This was set by CM
- 8 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
regulation Nr. 336 (2001) “Regulation on justifiable expenses for education and health care”
and the amount has not changed in many years and is totally inadequate today. Tuition fees
set by institutions of higher education are considerably higher. In addition, interview re-
sponses expressed concern about the tremendous amount of bureaucracy required to get
reimbursed for even part of the tax paid.
Study and student loans. Pluses and minuses. Student loans, available since 1997, offer
students considerable financial support. They are meant to cover living expenses for full-time
students. In 1999 study loans became available for both full and part-time students enrolled
in state and private institutions of higher education (Figure 4). The mentioned loan system
was established to make higher education more universally available. Both types of loans are
available to all successful students enrolled in accredited study programs, including studies
abroad. The loan system is regulated by several CM regulations and it is administered by a
specially created entity – the Study Foundation.
Initially the state budget was the source for loans. In 2000 the Cabinet of Ministers approved
a conceptual decision to switch gradually to crediting by commercial banks. From September
1, 2001 commercial banks started to issue loans with state guarantees. According to this
new procedure, loans are granted and administered by commercial banks that are selected
annually in public auction based on total loan amount and interest rate offered. The banks
having thus gained the right to deal in student loans receive from state budget the difference
between the interest rate paid by students and the established interest rate. The overall lend-
ing strategy is based on replacing loan funds from the state budget by sources from lending
institutions, thus easing the uptight state budget. The amount of loans has increased radi-
cally during the last few years.
Loans can be discharged with state budget funds. Based on the Cabinet of Ministers regula-
tion Nr. 219 (2001) “Procedure for approval, granting, repayment and discharge of study
loans from state budget funds”, loans are discharged for the following categories of students:
 Students who upon graduation start working in their area of specialization (academic or
professional) in professions at public or municipal institutions approved annually by the
Cabinet of Ministers;
 Handicapped persons of first and second group;
 In the case of death of loan recipient.
In line with the Cabinet of Ministers regulation Nr. 445 (2001) “Procedure for approval, grant-
ing, repayment and discharge of student loans from state budget funds”, loans are dis-
charged the same as described above. In addition, a student who has a child during the lend-
ing or repayment period needs to repay 30 per cent of the loan.
In evaluating the existing loan system, the majority (55 – 56%) of interviewed respondents
expressed opinion that it is more in the interest of society than not. There is agreement
among the respondents regarding innovations in the student loan system – 59 per cent of
- 9 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
them are of the opinion that the student should be able to choose his lending bank, without
tying banks to specific institutions of higher education; 36 per cent feel that the overseeing of
student loans must be simplified striking universities from the loan administration process.
Only one respondent suggested granting non-guaranteed loans.
Along with the procedure for determining the number of state budget funded study places,
both the lending system and study/student loan discharge system is a significant tool in train-
ing specialists in areas vital for national economy and sectors of national importance. It was
emphasized in interviews that in this way higher education becomes more accessible, social
expenditures are eased, student becomes more disciplined and successful, and the loans
have low interest rates and favourable repayment terms.
Nevertheless, representatives from the banking sector, Study Foundation, Chamber of trade
and industry admitted that the present student loan system does have weaknesses. Three
parties (the institution of higher education, the Study Foundation and the bank) are involved
in the lending process, which inhibits effective information exchange and complicates the
loan procedure. Resource quotas for student loans are divided among the institutions of
higher education. Most of the institutions use the quotas, however, some do not. Only some
institutions of higher education request additional loan funding for their students. Upon enter-
ing the institution of higher education students cannot immediately apply for a study loan
although the first tuition payment is due upon enrolment. The process for securing state
guarantee is rather lengthy. Study loans often do not cover all of the tuition costs. Therefore
the difference must be paid by student. The loan discharge system is not altogether clear.
Several institutions of higher education have electronic data processing problems and banks
receive faulty information. Bank requirements to qualify for a loan are overly stringent (man-
datory co-signer, mandatory account at that bank, salary direct deposit to that account).
These requirements could be eased if banks had to directly compete for borrower rather than
being awarded the right to a one-year monopoly in the study loan business.
2.3
Changes to be Expected
Current legislative and normative changes in the funding and development of the higher edu-
cation are focusing on improvement of functioning system. This section of study gives posi-
tion expressed by representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education and
Science, Ministry of Economics and Ministry of Regional Development and Local Govern-
ment.
Improvement in the budget funding mechanism. In order to promote faster development
of higher education a transition from the minimal study cost coefficient values to optimal val-
ues must be ensured, raising the minimal coefficient value by one tenth every year. This
process must be implemented gradually over the ten years period in accordance with the
Cabinet of Ministers regulation Nr. 334. Simultaneous funding must be increased for re-
search and doctoral studies. Raising the coefficients is a painfully slow process due to re-
- 10 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
stricted budget resources. This is particularly deterring vis à vis the studies in natural sci-
ences and engineering whose coefficients are higher.
State institutions of higher education, taking into account solvency, often set tuition fees
lower than the cost of state budget funded vacancies . This is especially true in upper level
study programs with high cost coefficients. This creates quality assurance problems in the
studies covered by tuition fees and threats to redistribute budget funding from the state
funded places to tuition fee covered vacancies.
Considering the increase of research funding and the distribution of this funding by type of
institutions of higher education, it can be expected that institutions will more clearly define
their stance towards research activities. Obviously, some institutions of higher education will
place emphasis on their research institution status and will accent innovation and applied
research.
Corruption is noted as a significant problem in Latvia. Respondents among public administra-
tion and Higher Education Council representatives noted that corruption has not touched the
financing of higher education and due to the present complexities of the system, it is practi-
cally impossible to do so. Favouring one institution of higher education manifests itself more
or less as lobbying. Politicians and government officials have for the most part graduated
from the bigger institutions of higher education. The opinion that state institutions of higher
education have a strong informal effect on state administration and its officials – graduates of
these same institutions of higher education – is quite prevalent.
Demographic challenges. The number of students is expected to decrease over the next
years. It will be determined by the very low birth rate in the early 1990s, and partially by in-
creasing enrolment of other EU institutions of higher education. The contribution to institution
of higher education budgets from the inner education market may decrease for this reason.
Institutions of higher education will be forced to pay special attention to external markets in
an effort to attract foreign students (forming business alliances, developing affiliated pro-
grams, franchise type activities abroad, branch campuses etc.).
It is quite conceivable that the decline in the student numbers will force public authorities to
use budget funding more effectively. Competition among institutions of higher education,
including private institutions, for state budget funding could be promoted, the distribution
mechanism of budget funding has to be improved, too. That in turn will force the institutions
of higher education to improve their strategies. More importance will have to be placed on
being informed about demand of national economy, lobbying methods may have to be im-
proved, too (if a tender procedure for distribution of funding will be accepted). Marketing
methods will be used more and more and institutions of higher education will have to clearly
mark their role in the national and global higher education market, especially if the budget
funding model of “the money follows the student” will be realized and the student will be
given free choice to enrol any institution of higher education.
- 11 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
Development of research and doctoral studies. It is most likely that state budget funds for
graduate and post-graduate studies will continue to increase both in number of vacancies as
well as the funding per student. Some institutions of higher education will see an increase in
the state budget share of their respective budgets, which will result in more attention being
paid to the demands of the state. The Scientific Activity Law adopted in 2005 states that the
Cabinet of Ministers, when drafting and submitting its annual budget law to the Saeima, pro-
jects an annual increase in research funding no less than 0,15 per cent of the GDP until the
time that the total state subsidy reaches one per cent of the GDP (Latvijas Vestnesis, 2005).
The position of the Higher Education council states that the ratio between research and edu-
cation funding does not have to be the same in all institutions of higher education. Research
is traditionally funded less at private institutions of higher education, but academic staff from
state institutions of higher education supplement their ranks and ensure the study process.
The university status by definition means a pronounced emphasis on research, especially
fundamental research. Universities collaborate with and render assistance to academies and
other institutions of higher education which are more oriented to labour market needs and
are more involved in applied research.
Both EU funding and state budget financing of investment programs in higher education will
increase. It is conceivable that institutions of higher education will pay more attention to the
realization of the EU and national higher education policy statements.
The effect of the funding system on the accessibility of higher education. Only 38 per
cent of the representatives of institutions of higher education feel that the current system of
financing promotes accessibility of higher education. 37 per cent feel that it does not promote
accessibility at all, 20 per cent feel that it has no effect whatsoever, but 5 per cent of them
had no opinion on this question. To promote access to higher education, socio-economic
factors should be considered when distributing funding for students. In response to the ques-
tion “What should be considered in awarding state budget subsidy?” 33 per cent of the re-
spondents named family income, 15 per cent - social conditions in the family, 13 per cent -
student’s place of residence. Of the remaining 39 per cent, who named other factors, aca-
demic success and cost of study programs were mentioned most often. These are already
the main criteria for accepting students into university and for awarding state budget subsidy.
The efficiency of use of financial resources at state and private institutions of higher
education. Private institutions of higher education with the exception of the Higher School of
Social Work and Social Pedagogies “Attistiba” do not receive state budget funding. They are
functioning under the guidelines of commerce legislation. All state institutions of higher edu-
cation with the exception of the Banking College of Higher Education receive state budget
subsidy for education and also enrol students for a fee. Thus it is difficult to do a comparative
analysis of the performance of both types of institutions. In the opinion of most of the respon-
dents, the effectiveness issue should be addressed as a complex. There is less scientific
activity and its infrastructure for it at private institutions of higher education, but they are
- 12 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
rather effective in the study sector and tend to react to changes in market demand more
quickly than state institutions. The latter have less autonomy in resource management than
do private institutions.
Measures implemented to reach the goals of the Lisbon Strategy. In accordance with
EU economic policy and employment guidelines, in October 2005 the Cabinet of Ministers
accepted Latvia’s national Lisbon Program for 2005 – 2008. It points to the problems and
main areas of activity needed to implement the Lisbon Strategy in Latvia, as well as target
indicators. In order to assure completion of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, the gov-
ernment has formed a Lisbon Strategy Monitoring Council led by the Minister of Economy.
The Council also consists of ministers involved in the Lisbon Strategy realization, representa-
tives of the Saeima, municipalities and social partners. Ministries and other responsible insti-
tutions ensure completion of Latvia’s national Lisbon Program for 2005 – 2008 within the
assigned budget guidelines.
2.4
The Influence of the Higher Education Funding System on Institutional
Strategies
Main features of institutional strategies. The majority of institutions of higher education in
Latvia have formulated and confirmed their development strategies. Sometimes these docu-
ments are formulated as institutions’ management programs. The available development
strategy documents are not very extensive. They address the following main issues: 1) per-
sonnel development (attracting a new personnel, changes in the structure of academic staff,
development of personnel holding doctoral degrees); 2) curriculum development (develop-
ment of new study programs, compliance with labour market needs, regional and national
demands and global trends); 3) promotion of research activities (regional needs, attracting
funding from external sources, particularly from the EU research programs and funds, pro-
moting innovation); 4) infrastructural development (room repairs, search for new facilities,
study and research equipment, library development, information technology development
etc.).
The development of international collaboration is less significant in institutional strategies (a
student and staff mobility is mentioned, development of joint and double degree study pro-
grams, enrolment of foreign students), as well as development of institutional management
(democratization of decision making, structural improvements). Quantitative indicators like
share of research funding, number of students, and goal attainment criteria, responsibility for
goal attainment, appear in the strategies very rarely. Preparation of strategies and their reali-
zation process is not clearly described. The strategies characteristically refrain from serious
use of marketing. The target market is seldom emphasized, nor is pricing, increasing market
opportunities etc.
The formation of institutional strategies and influential factors involved. The strategic
development document is usually the institution’s management program or guidelines for its
- 13 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
activities. Administrative departments, collegial governing bodies, representatives from aca-
demic staff and heads of academic divisions are involved in preparation of strategy as well.
Stakeholders (public and private sector employers, representatives from non-governmental
organizations, students and graduates) are rarely involved in preparatory process. Usually
they are involved in discussions about already formulated guidelines.
The opinion that the rector should be the key person involved in forming a university strategy
is dominant. In many cases the strategy is defined by the rector’s pre-election program,
which is more or less formulated by the individual candidate. In cases when the university
strategy is confirmed by the senate or another governing body, the rector’s role in the proc-
ess is prominent.
The formulation of institutional strategies is not described in any other managerial documents
therefore it is not easy to describe a list of determinants forming strategy. However, based on
strategy content, in our opinion, the most important elements of a strategy are: 1) analysis of
the present situation at the institution of higher education – personnel, resource analysis,
institutional traditions, market position assessment etc.; 2) relative advantages of the institu-
tion in the near future – a statement of students’ demands, its determinants and trends,
changes in the offer study programs, staff involvement in research; 3) opinion of the admini-
stration regarding priority development directions and institutional management policy.
The relationship between the funding system and institutional strategies. Institutional
strategies have, for the most part, developed due to the existing system of funding. Within
this context they can be characterized by:
 Emphasis on the role of the study process. The long term shortage of research funding
has forced institutions of higher education to focus more on income from tuition fees and
other sources in large part dependent from educational activities of the institution;
 Emphasis on compliance with national educational market demands rather than global or
EU market demands. This is due to the fact that the educational market provides the ma-
jor part of the budget of the institution of higher education. Some institutions of higher
education perceive all of Latvia as their market, for others it is a specific region;
 Less emphasis on the need to attract state budget funding for specific programs. Institu-
tions of higher education tend to rely on their own revenues and infrastructure;
 Little attention paid to foreign markets, enrolment of foreign students. The portion of reve-
nues earned from foreign students is small. A deterring factor in this regard is the national
policy towards foreign students, which has been very stringent;
 Increased emphasis on attracting EU funding. During the last two years we have seen that
EU funding is available for refurbishing the studies and research infrastructure, curriculum
development etc. This is why institutions of higher education are interested and have
started to emphasize this in their strategy documents.
- 14 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
A chronological assessment of institutional strategies brings us to the conclusion that their
formulation has been effected by changes in the funding system. For example, the strategies
formulated during the mid 1990s placed less emphasis on education market factors and the
development of research was hardly ever mentioned.
The funding system of higher education institutions and course for its improvement.
54 per cent of principals of higher education institutions consider the present system of fi-
nancing as unsatisfactory, 41 per cent rate it as satisfactory, but needing significant im-
provements. Only 5 per cent of the respondents feel that the present system does not need
any improvements.
There is no consensus among the leadership of Latvia’s institutions of higher education re-
garding the most appropriate system of higher education funding from the state budget. 42
per cent of the respondents feel that the state should continue to allocate budget subsidy
according to determined student numbers, 27 per cent feel that funding should follow the
student and 23 per cent believe that institutions of higher education should be funded based
on outcomes. All the private university administrators believe that funding should follow stu-
dents, who choose in which institution to study. Only eight respondents feel that the state
should not fund higher education institutions at all, but all students should pay tuition fees
and apply for study loans.
Nor is there any consensus regarding the most effective distribution of state funding. 24 per
cent of the respondents feel that fewer students should receive state financing, but the fund-
ing per student should be increased. 14 per cent of the respondents feel that more students
should receive state budget funding, 21 per cent feel that the number and diversity of educa-
tional institutions should be reduced, but 7 per cent feel that the above should be increased.
34 per cent of the respondents suggest their own solution to the problem: increase of funding
(most often mentioned), provide equitable support for regional institutions of higher educa-
tion, finance higher education based on priorities set forth in the national development plan,
finance institutions based on results or academic success indicators. 4/5 of private university
administrators feel that the funding per student should be increased.
Institutional Foundations. Based on their strategic guidelines and existing legislation, insti-
tutions of higher education are establishing foundations and agencies in order to gain more
autonomy in dealing with their resources and to separate them from state funds, which are
controlled by the state. According to the ministries, this is simply an attempt to circumvent
bureaucracy and gain additional funding to distribute as institutions see it. In the opinion of
the Chamber of trade and industry representatives, institutions of higher education are at-
tempting to solve the problems of financial flow, which are caused by legal restrictions and
liens. Business representatives admit that foundations do somewhat help to resolve the is-
sues of current funding model. According to the representative from the Ministry of Econom-
ics: “If foundations are closely monitored and the utilization of funds occurs in compliance
with the goals of the university, they help promote the development of higher education and
- 15 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
results in more effective use of state funding for public institutions of higher education. The
amount of cash flow in institutional foundations is small, however, and does not significantly
affect the funding system of higher education. Foundations are not the solution to the prob-
lem of inadequate funding”.

2.5.1
Strengths and Weaknesses of the Funding System and Development of
Higher Education: a Summary of the Stakeholders’ Opinions
Strengths
Higher education is traditionally very highly valued in society. The largest state institutions of
higher education are very prestigious. The number of students per 1000 inhabitants has in-
creased steadily since the mid-1990s and now it is among the highest in the EU and the
world. In 2005 the number of students per 1000 inhabitants was 562 (IZM, 2006). Political
understanding of the significance of higher education has increased. Latvia has entirely be-
come part of the European higher education space.
The number of institutions of higher education has increased since 1991. The private institu-
tions (which mainly focus on the social sciences) and regional institutions of higher education
have been established. The network of branch campuses is developing throughout the coun-
try. Along with growing competitiveness among the institutions, new and more diverse study
programs are being offered, including evening and weekend programs for working students,
correspondence courses, e-courses. The government has set the development of programs
in engineering and the natural sciences as its priorities.
The funding system of higher education institution is continuously being improved. Given
insufficient state budget funding, the tuition fee system is developing at both state and private
institutions of higher education, making higher education more accessible. Tuition fees are
subject to tax advantages as well.
A comprehensive study and student loan program has been established. Graduates of higher
education institutions can apply to have their loan discharged from state budget. Scholar-
ships awarded by the state have become bigger.
In recent years institutions of higher education have successfully attracted more EU financ-
ing, state budget funding for research and development has increased.
2.5.2
Weaknesses
The governmental decision to increase funding of higher education by 10 per cent annually
has not been realized. Inadequate investment has been made in the development of infra-
structure, expanding library resources, the share of investments in total expenditure is low.
Research funding in the institutions of higher education still was inadequate. The current
- 16 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
system of awarding state budget subsidy does not encourage institutions to improve quality
assurance, because the funding is not results oriented.
State and private institutions of HE operate under inequitable competitive conditions.
The collaboration between institutions of higher education, employers and professional asso-
ciations is weak. Study programs often are superficial and general, competencies and skills
gained do not correspond fully to the demands of the labour market. Study programs tend to
be quite fragmented (more than 500 programs have been registered), which does not en-
courage consolidation of academic personnel and development of research.
The extensive technology and investment programs have disappeared due to inadequate
investment in their development.
Existing legislation does not encourage the participation of the employers in the funding of
education of their factual and potential future employees. These include paying students’
tuition, discharging student loans, scholarship support and others.
The distribution of budgetary funds among institutes of higher education and thematic groups
of study programs takes place based on criteria that are not rather clear and understandable
fro all players in the educational market. Future long term demands for definite specialists
have not been clearly identified. Students are restricted in their choice of study direction and
institution, because opportunities to compete for state budget funded vacancies are inequita-
ble. For this reason, the choice of study field is often made based on financial considerations
rather than interest or ability. The distribution of students by type of study program is rather
disproportionate (every second student is in the social sciences).
Different conditions of managing financial resources in the state and private institutions of
higher education. Private schools comply with commercial legislation while management of
financial resources, including tuition fees, in state institutions are regulated by more strict
provisions of budget institutions. Cross-subsidization between budget funded and tuition fee
funded studies, between different level and type of study programs still exist in educational
establishments.
The number of students per faculty is disproportionately high (30 students per faculty mem-
ber in Latvia, 15 students per faculty member in OECD countries). Extremely high is students
to professors ratio - there are 100 students per professor in Latvia. Academic personnel are
aging and qualified young replacements are sorely lacking.
Study loans for the most part do not completely cover the tuition costs. There is no direct
contact between the bank and the institution of higher education, which delays the lending
process. This is especially important for first year students, who have to personally pay the
tuition costs at the beginning of studies. Students are not allowed to choose a bank of their
choice for a loan; the loan discharge system is not clear enough.
- 17 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
Social factors such as family income are not taken into consideration when awarding funding
(including scholarships), which limits access of poorer students to higher education. The pro-
portion of students working parallel to their studies is very high.
There is a relatively low salary differentiation based on level of education and obtained quali-
fication, resulting in lack of motivation to continue schooling beyond the secondary level.
Graduates of specific programs (teachers, for example) are not motivated to work in their
specialty due to the inadequate salary level.
There has been a very small increase in the number of state budget subsidized study
places. Therefore proportion of state budget funded students in the total student population is
declining. There is practically no competition among the candidates to tuition fee covered
study vacancies; in reality anyone able to pay is accepted. This is a threat to the quality of
education. The dropout rate is considerable. The number of doctoral students and doctoral
degree recipients is low (0.4 per cent of total number of graduates in all cycles of higher edu-
cation).
3 Conclusions
Interviews and discussions with stakeholders as well as analysis of statistics, policy docu-
ments and legislation lead us to the following conclusions about the funding and its effect on
the development of higher education in Latvia:
 The rapid growth of the higher education sector in Latvia became possible due to growing
demand for higher education, the increase in number and type of educational facilities, in-
cluding private and regional institutions of higher education, and tuition fee programs. All
of these factors contributed to the formation of a higher education market. State and pri-
vate institutions activity in this market stimulates the development of the higher education
system.
 Introduction of a tuition fee system has made higher education more accessible. A signifi-
cant turning point in the development of higher education is the establishment of a study
and a student loan program. The lending process, however, must be simplified. Loan ad-
ministration functions should in fact be removed from the institutions of higher education
and delegated to the Study Foundation. Loan amount quotas should be divided not
among institutions, but rather among nationally significant study areas.
 The mechanism of normative allocation of state budget subsidy at institutions of higher
education has resulted in a more stable academic development planning. However, there
is no guarantee of special normative compliance with real needs of educational institu-
tions, especially in the field of modern technologies. Increased state budget funding in the
higher education sector would make create opportunity to increase number of graduate
- 18 -Funding Systems and their Effects on Higher Education Systems – Latvia
and post-graduate students. The continued growth in the number of students is seriously
threatened in the near future by the decline of fertility.
 Different conditions of competition exist for state and private institutions of higher educa-
tion. All players in the market should have to comply with the same rules regarding man-
aging of financial resources, asset management, language of instruction and rights to
claim for state budget subsidy.
 The existing tax system does not promote involvement of businesses sector to support the
higher education system, making it difficult for an employer to invest in the education of
his employees, nor does it facilitate collaboration in education and research with institu-
tions of higher education. All business transacted with institutions of higher education re-
lated to training or research should qualify for tax advantages.
 The Ministry of Education and Science supervise most of the institutions of higher educa-
tion in Latvia. A transparent resource allocation system regarding higher education devel-
opment for all ministries is lacking. It is recommended to establish competition procedures
to ensure more transparency of funding activities.
 The higher education funding system directly affects the institutional strategies. Market
concerns are dominating more and more in strategic documents. Recently more emphasis
is being placed on attracting funds via research and other projects.
 Some institutions of higher education have established foundations in order to attract ad-
ditional funding. However, the results are less than satisfactory. Deterring factors include
lack of experience in fundraising and a resistance to donating, both on the part of society
as well as legislators.
 The existing criteria and system of state budget allocation among institutions of higher
education is not transparent enough. State funds support the most talented among stu-
dents, but do not stimulate a greater access to higher education among the nations poor.

1.
This paper puts forward a strategy for achieving two objectives in higher education –
improved access and increased quality – about which there is unanimous agreement.
2.
D IAGNOSIS . The introduction of income-contingent repayments in 1998 was a genuine and
enormous advance. However, two strategic problems remain. First, income-contingency is little
understood, causing unnecessary fear of debt (solutions are discussed in section 4.2). Second, all the
funding problems of the current system go back – directly or indirectly – to the subsidised interest rate
on student loans. Australia and New Zealand face identical problems for identical reasons.
3.
Interest subsidies create three problems. They are badly-targeted, mainly benefiting high-
earning graduates in mid career. They are expensive (a recently-developed model estimates
conservatively that out of next year's lending to students of £2500 million about £700 million will
never come back because of interest subsidies). Third, because loans are so expensive, the Treasury
rations them. Thus interest subsidies, like most subsidies harm the people they are meant to help.
There was an experiment with subsidies called Communism. It did not work. The result is that loans
are too small, leading to student poverty and extensive use of credit card debt; and loans are means-
tested: thus parental contributions and upfront costs continue.
4.
P RESCRIPTION . If graduates pay an interest rate equal to the government's cost of borrowing
(not the bank overdraft rate), repayments increase from about 50% of total borrowing to about 85%
(the remaining 15% shortfall being mainly due to low lifetime earnings), largely eliminating the fiscal
impediment to expanding loans. The move is politically less difficult than it sounds. Interest rates are
currently low, so that a move to the government's cost of borrowing involves only a small increase to
the rate that graduates pay. Second, a graduate's monthly repayments depend only on her income;
thus an increase in interest rates has no effect on monthly repayments, instead affecting the duration of
the loan – making it clear that repayments are simply a form of targeted income tax.
5.
P OLICIES . Removing interest subsidies is the single essential key to solving current funding
problems. The considerable resources thereby released underwrite the strategy for quality and access
in section 4. The strategy has three mutually reinforcing elements: flexible fees, a wide-ranging loan
system and active measures to promote access.
6.
Flexible fees are necessary to reflect diversity, to arrest quality decline and to assist some
redistribution of teaching budget towards institutions with more remedial teaching. Specifically, fees
should be increased initially to £2000, but with institutions free to charge less. All fees should be
fully covered by a loan entitlement.
7.
A wide-ranging loan system.
• Loans should be adequate to cover living costs and tuition fees, making higher education free
at the point of use, thus addressing student poverty and freeing students from high-cost
borrowing such as overdrafts and credit card debt.
• Loan entitlement should become universal, eliminating the unpopular and complex income
test and, at a stroke, getting rid of parental contributions.
The combined effect of these twin elements is equivalent to bringing in universal grants in
combination with an income-related graduate contribution (section 4.2). Additional options include
extending loans to students in further education and to postgraduates.
8.
Active measures to promote access. There are two impediments to access – financial poverty
and information poverty. The strategy outlined in section 4.3 aims to address both.

Nicholas Barr 2
1.
This paper sets out a strategy for promoting access and strengthening quality. Though
explicitly about higher education, the arguments apply equally to the tertiary sector as a
whole. Successive sections discuss:
• The many things we all agree about.
• Lessons from economic theory.
• Problems with current arrangements, and key elements of solutions, including an
indication of the scale of the prize to be won.
• A policy strategy.
1 What we all agree about
2.
Since the finance of higher education is controversial, it is useful to start by setting
out some large areas of unanimous agreement.
3.
T HE PROBLEM . There is agreement, first, about two core problems:
• Students are poor because the system of support does not give them enough to live
on. Two results follow: students have to turn to expensive overdraft and credit-card
debt and/or to extensive part-time work; and the parsimony of support is an
impediment to access for people contemplating university.
• Universities are poor, creating worries about quality. The UK would have to spend
an extra £3.5 billion per year to reach the EU average.
4.
O BJECTIVES . There is also agreement – strong and universal agreement – about two
central objectives.

This paper draws on Barr (2001, Chs 10-14), and in part on work while a Visiting Scholar at the Fiscal Affairs
Department at the IMF in Spring 2000. It also draws on collaboration on policy design with Iain Crawford for
more years than either of us care to contemplate, on advice on factual matters and administrative feasibility from
Colin Ward and his team at the Student Loans Company, and on recent work by the three of us on a project
advising the Hungarian government. An earlier version was presented at a meeting of the Parliamentary
Universities Group.

http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/nb• Improved access. The socioeconomic mix in higher education has barely changed in
40 years. Everyone supports widening participation in the interests of social justice,
and also for reasons of national economic performance.
• Improved quality. Again, there is no disagreement: the quality and diversity of higher
education is important for its own sake, and for national competitiveness.
5.
F OUR PROPOSITIONS . Resources are clearly key to achieving these objectives. To that
end, the discussion of resources throughout the paper is based on four propositions.
• UK higher education needs substantial additional funding for reasons of national
economic performance and because higher education is an important export industry.
• Funding on the necessary scale will not come from the taxpayer, given an ageing
population, rising health expenditure, competition from other parts of the education
sector and competitive global pressures.
• Reform will therefore be ineffective unless it can deliver an immediate and sustained
injection of private funding. The way to achieve this is through a student loan scheme
which can draw in private finance on fiscally attractive terms.
• Phasing out the interest subsidy on the current loan scheme is essential to that end.
Interest subsidies are costly (about one-third of total lending never comes back
because of their cost), distortionary and badly-targeted. Instead of paying an interest
rate equal to the rate of inflation (as currently), graduates should pay a rate equal to
the government's cost of borrowing (not the interest rate on bank overdrafts or credit
cards). The considerable savings would be much better used to expand the loan
system and for the explicit, targeted measures to promote access set out in section 4.3.
2 Lessons from economic theory
6.
Economic theory offers three strong sets of results, summarised here briefly. 3
7.
T HE DAYS OF CENTRAL PLANNING HAVE GONE , both for students and for higher
education institutions. The system should empower the individual choices of students and
potential students. The key theoretical question is whether students are well-informed or can
become well-informed. My answer is yes. The role of government is not to plan student
choices, but to make sure that students have easy access to timely, accurate and relevant
information and – particularly for students from poorer backgrounds – also to advice.
8.
The supply side should also be liberalised. Forty years ago, with an elite system, it
was possible, as a polite myth, to assume that all universities were equally good and hence
3
For fuller discussion, see Barr (2001, Chs 11 and 12).
Nicholas Barr April 2002
2could be funded broadly equally. Today we have a mass system, meaning more higher
education institutions, more students, and much greater diversity of subject matter – all
changes which are warmly to be welcomed. As a result, however, the characteristics and the
costs of different degrees at different institutions vary widely. Thus universities need to be
funded differentially. In principle this could be done by an all-knowing central planner. In
practice, the problem is too complex for that to be the sole mechanism. A mass system in an
increasingly complex world needs a funding mechanism which allows institutions to charge
differential prices to reflect their differential characteristics.
9.
Supply-side liberalisation is not only necessary; it is also desirable. Increased
competition between institutions will make them more responsive to student preferences.
Some students will wish to study full-time but on an accelerated basis, for example studying
for four terms per year rather than three; others, in contrast, will wish to study part-time, for
example through evening courses. A system which can offer students and prospective
students a wider range of choice is efficient; and the added option of part-time study while
continuing to work also assists access.
10.
G RADUATES SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE COSTS OF THEIR DEGREES . A second strong
result from economic theory is that higher education should not be free – its costs should be
shared between the taxpayer and the graduate. There are two mutually reinforcing arguments.
11.
We cannot afford free higher education. The argument is simple. Forty years ago,
with a 5% participation rate it was fiscally feasible to rely mainly on public funding to
support a high-quality higher education system. The welcome expansion to a 35%
participation rate, with aspirations to a 50% rate, however, mean that public funding has to be
supplemented on a significant scale by private funding. This is all the more the case because:
12.
We should not have free higher education. It is well-known that graduates on average
have significantly higher earnings than non-graduates. The Dearing Report (National
Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, 1997, para. 18.13) suggests that
'compared to those without higher education qualifications who were qualified to
enter higher education, those with higher education qualifications:
• have higher employment rates;
• enjoy higher salaries;
• enjoy an average private rate of return of some 11 to 14 per cent'.
13.
Since higher education creates social benefits it is right that there should always be a
taxpayer contribution. But given the robust evidence on private rates of return, excessive
reliance on public funding is inefficient. It is also regressive, and hence unjust, since the
major beneficiaries of free higher education are the predominantly middle-class participants.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
3A government committed to improving access should not spray scarce taxpayer pounds
indiscriminately across the entire student body but should instead target those resources on
people for whom access is most fragile.
14.
A WELL - DESIGNED STUDENT LOAN SCHEME HAS CORE FEATURES . The third set of
conclusions from economic theory sheds light on the design of student loans. Four features
stand out, summarised here only briefly (for fuller discussion, see Barr, 2001, Ch. 12).
• Income-contingent repayments, i.e. loans with repayments calculated as x% of the
graduate's subsequent earnings until she has repaid her loan, are fundamental. The
arguments are now well-understood. Income-contingent repayments instantly and
automatically respond to changes in earnings: people with low earnings make low
repayments; and people with low lifetime earnings do not repay in full. The effect is
to protect borrowers against excessive risk, with gains both in efficiency and in terms
of access (see also Barr and Crawford, 1997, evidence to this Committee).
• Large enough to cover all living costs and all tuition fees. This feature makes higher
education free at the point of use – the important advance made by the Cubie
arrangements in Scotland. Students are no longer pushed towards expensive credit-
card debt; and parental contributions can be abolished, a liberation both for students
and their parents.
• An unsubsidised interest rate, as explained in section 3.3, is essential for fiscal
reasons, for efficiency reasons, and in the interests of access.
• A capacity to bring in private funds. Student loans bring in private funding through
students' subsequent repayments. However, there is a net saving to the taxpayer only
when the scheme is mature, i.e. when the inflow of repayments from earlier cohorts of
students matches or exceeds the outgoings to this year's borrowers. That process takes
15-20 years. If extra resources are needed immediately, it is desirable to have a loan
scheme which brings in private money upfront, creating an immediate injection of
private finance.
3 Problems with current arrangements 4
3.1 The good news
15.
Income-contingent loans, with repayments collected alongside income tax, were
introduced for UK students starting their degrees in or after 1998. This move represents
unambiguous progress and deserves loud applause.
4
For assessment of systems of higher education finance in other countries (the USA, Australia, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and Sweden), see Barr (2001, Ch. 13). National Audit Office (2002) reaches very similar
conclusions about the problems of the present system, in particular its failure to improve access.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
43.2 The bad news
16.
That, however, exhausts the good news. The problems described below were both
predictable and predicted, e.g. Barr and Crawford (1997) in evidence to this Committee.
S TUDENT SUPPORT : IMPEDIMENTS TO ACCESS
17.
The system of student support impedes access in several ways.
18.
D EFICIENT LOAN DESIGN . The current scheme conforms with only one of the four
criteria – income-contingent repayments – in para. 14. It fails the remaining three badly.
• The loan is too small to cover living costs; it is income tested, so that not all students
are entitled to a full loan; and there is no loan to cover tuition fees. Thus the system
incorporates upfront charges, students remain poor, and parental contributions
continue. All these features impede access.
• The loan incorporates an interest subsidy. The resulting problems are discussed in
detail in section 3.3.
• The scheme is capable of bringing in private finance but, because of the interest
subsidy, only on fiscally unattractive terms, again, discussed further below.
19.
C ONTINUED RELIANCE ON PARENTAL
contributions merit additional discussion.
CONTRIBUTIONS .
The problems of parental
• As a philosophical matter, is it right to force young adults to depend on their parents?
• Student poverty: the scale and volume of unpaid contributions is well known. 5
• Impediments to access: unpaid contributions cause some students to drop out, and the
threat of unpaid contributions deters an unknown number of others from applying in
the first place.
• Distorted choices: in other cases, parents pay the contribution, but with conditions
attached: 'we will pay, but only if you do a sensible subject.'
• The previous three problems all have troubling gender and ethnic aspects, and the
point is, if anything, even stronger in respect of spouse contributions.
5
Barr and Low (1988), using data for 1982/3, found that about half of students entitled to parental contribution
received less than they were supposed to, and the shortfall was substantial: students whose parents gave them
less than the system supposed received only £53 of every £100 of assessed parental contribution. As a result,
one student in thirteen remained below the poverty line even when income from all sources was included.
Subsequent work based on 1992/3 data found that 37 per cent of students received less than the assessed
parental contribution (Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals (1996, p. 14), quoting an official survey).
Callender and Kemp (2000, p. 3) report that 'By 1998/9, the proportion of students who failed to receive their
full assessed parental contribution had doubled to three in ten students. The mean shortfall for these students
(average assessed contribution minus average actual parental contribution) was £719'
Nicholas Barr April 2002
5•
The income test necessary to assess parental contributions is intrusive and has high
compliance and administrative costs.
20.
Its gets worse! Assessment of family income has to take account of whether a student
is making maintenance payments (a deduction from his assessable income) or is the recipient
of maintenance payments (which may be an addition to his assessable income) (Department
of Education and Skills, 2001, Ch. 6, paras 54-58). And the relevance of a spouse's income
raises the vexed issue of cohabitation: a woman whose husband has a high salary is not
entitled to a full loan; nor is one whose partner has a high income – but that requires finding
out whether or not a student is cohabiting. Paras B117-8 of the guidance notes just cited are
titled 'Advice on identifying a cohabiting couple'. Such factors – which should lie wholly
outside the system of student support – are an inescapable concomitant of an income test.
21.
None of this is an attack on family support: where families wish to help, such support
should be applauded. The attack is twofold. Policy should not be based on an assumption that
parents will support their children. Such an assumption may, at a stretch, have been valid for
an elite system of higher education, regarded as a luxury good for middle-class families; it is
invalid for mass higher education as an investment good, and totally inapplicable to
expanding access. The policy is bad also because it forces students into dependence on
parental contributions or spouse contributions, since there is no option to take out a larger
loan in place of unpaid contributions.
22.
C OMPLEXITY . Annex 1 gives a very simplified explanation of the current system. But
student support in practice is so complex that nobody fully understands the system. 6 Someone
from a poor background pays no tuition fee and is entitled to a full loan. The assessment of a
student's financial position is based on parental income for a younger student, or on his or her
spouse's or partner's income. Parental or spouse income has two effects: as income rises, the
tuition fee rises; once the fee has reached its maximum (£1,075 in 2001/2), the effect of
additional parental income is to reduce the size of the loan to which the student is entitled. All
students, however rich their parents or spouse, are entitled to a loan equal to about 75 per cent
of the maximum loan except that scholarship and similar income, if high enough, can reduce
loan entitlement below that 75 per cent minimum. 7 Such complexity has major ill-effects:
students, prospective students, and their parents cannot understand the system; it is a
nightmare to administer; and complexity, per se, impedes access.
6
Without wishing to seem frivolous, I challenge Committee members to explain the operation of the income-
test by which a student's loan entitlement and tuition fee are assessed, as set out in the guidance notes from the
Department for Education and Skills (2001) to the Local Education Authorities, who administer the income test
(http://www.dfes.gov.uk/studentsupport/ss_admin/content/dsp_section_29.shtml, Chapter 6).
7
Originally, a student's loan entitlement was reduced pound for pound with any scholarship income in excess of
£1000 per year. The disregard was subsequently increased; in 2001/2 it is £4000 (Department for Education
and Skills, 2001, Table 5).

I NADEQUATE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION . Perhaps the greatest impediment to
access is the fact that the wider public totally fails to understand income-contingent
repayments. The scale of this ignorance cannot be exaggerated. Most people are completely
unaware that loan repayments are de facto a form of income tax – but paid only by graduates
and switched off once the graduate has repaid what he or she borrowed. In this respect, the
Government is deeply culpable over its negligence in vigorously and repeatedly explaining
this point. The resulting ignorance unnecessarily aggravates debt aversion and is a further
impediment to access. The topic is taken up in detail in paras 63-73.
U NIVERSITIES :
24.
IMPEDIMENTS TO QUALITY
The post-Dearing arrangements are also bad news on the supply side.
25.
C ONTINUED CENTRAL PLANNING . The strong theoretical case against central planning
of higher education was alluded to earlier. Though nobody quarrels with the need for
universities to be publicly and transparently accountable, there are few defenders of the
particular mechanisms, of which the QAA and RAE are only the tip of the iceberg. In
addition, there has been central control of the number of students at each university and of
tuition fees – in other words, both price and quantity were determined by the central planner
– a situation only partly eased by the proposed lifting of the numbers cap.
26.
Such planning impedes quality. Also – and entirely unintended – it impedes access to
UK students to the best universities. Again, this was predicted to this Committee:
'A flat fee will continue the erosion of quality at the best universities, which face the
biggest shortfalls. If this policy continues, the result will be to deprive British
students of the chance of an internationally cutting-edge undergraduate degree in one
of two ways. The quality of the best institutions might fall; British students could still
get places, but the quality of the degree would be less. Alternatively, the best
institutions will largely stop teaching British undergraduates (for whom they receive
on average £4000 per year) and will use the fees from foreign undergraduates (around
£8000 per year) to preserve their excellence. The government is considering trying to
prevent British universities from charging additional fees to UK/EU students. Again,
this is done for equity reasons; again, it ends up harming the very people it is aimed at
helping, in this case by creating a situation where British students will find it harder
and harder to get places at the best universities' (Barr and Crawford, 1997, para. 57).
27.
I NADEQUATE UNIVERSITY INCOME . The immediate post-Dearing arrangements
brought universities not an extra penny, for the reasons explained in Barr and Crawford
(1997), with worrying effects on quality. The story in 1997, in a nutshell, was as follows:
Nicholas Barr April 2002
7(a) Public spending on higher education would not go up (the budget said so).
(b) Parental contributions (i.e. private spending) would not go up (the Secretary of State
said so). 8
(c) Loans to students (the other potential source of private spending) counted in their
entirety as public spending.
28.
There has been some improvement since 1997. Public spending under (a) has
increased; debt sales have brought in some private money under (c); and the move from
cash-flow to resource accounting has further assisted under (c). These developments are all
genuinely welcome; but they do not change the reality that, at its core, the system continues
to be publicly funded; and given its greater political salience, student support has crowded
out university income. The story in Australia is exactly the same (see Annex 3, para. 95), and
for exactly the same underlying reason – the interest subsidy on student loans.
3.3 The worst news: interest subsidies
T HE PROBLEM
29. It is important to understand the scale of the problems that interest subsidies cause.
30. W HAT INTEREST RATE ? First, it is important to be clear what I am not saying:
• At present graduates pay an interest rate equal to the rate of inflation. Press
discussion of 'market interest rates' evokes worries about high interest rates associated
with credit cards and overdrafts. That is not what is meant. The interest rate which
graduates should pay on their loans is the government's cost of borrowing, i.e. broadly
the interest rate the Monetary Policy Committee announces.
• The attack is on blanket interest subsidies. A strong case can be made for targeted
interest subsidies – for example someone who is unemployed or caring for young
children or other dependants – to make sure that their debt does not spiral upwards.
Mechanisms for such targeted assistance are discussed in section 4.2.
31.
W HY ARE INTEREST SUBSIDIES SUCH A PROBLEM ? Interest subsidies are:
•
Regressive. As explained in paras 42 and 43, interest subsidies do not benefit students
(who do not make repayments), nor low-earning graduates, but better-off graduates in
mid-career.
8
‘Today the Government announce a new deal for higher education, involving new funding for universities and
colleges, free higher education for the less well-off, no parent having to pay more than at present and a fair
system of repayment linked to ability to pay' (Hansard (Commons), 23 July 1997, col. 949) (emphasis added).
‘Our response to Dearing ensures that fees and maintenance together do not place an increased burden on
middle-income families' (ibid., col. 950).
Nicholas Barr April 2002
8• Expensive. Interest subsidies are enormously costly. Evidence from debt sales
suggests that of all the money lent to students, about one-third never comes back
because of the cost of interest subsidies. The scale of the resulting losses is discussed
shortly. The high fiscal costs of loans create two further sets of ill-effects.
• Inimical to quality. Expensive student support crowds out university income; thus
interest subsidies conflict directly with improved quality.
• Distortionary. Because loans are so expensive, the Treasury rations them. Thus
interest subsidies, like most subsidies, create shortages – like rent control, they end up
harming the very people they were meant to help. There was an experiment with
price subsidies called Communism. It did not work.
32.
In the case of loans, shortages manifest themselves in the following ways:
• The full loan is too small to cover a student's living costs, leading to student poverty.
• Loans are means-tested: as a result parental/spouse/partner contributions continue,
and higher education involves upfront costs and charges.
• Loans are restricted, for example are not available to students in further education
(impeding access), nor to postgraduates (putting national competitiveness at risk).
T OWARDS A SOLUTION :
THE SCALE OF THE PRIZE
33.
In short, interest subsidies create a fiscal black hole which aggravates problems both
of access and quality. 9 A move to an unsubsidised rate is not just a technicality – it is the
single essential key to solving current problems of funding tertiary education. The
considerable resources thereby released underwrite the array of major policy advances set out
in section 4.
9
Other countries are reaching a similar conclusion. New Zealand, having flirted with interest subsidies since
2000, are contemplating reversing that short-lived, ill-advised experiment. A government report published last
November, concluded that:
'Participation goals should continue to be supported through a Student Loan Scheme with income-contingent
repayments as at present. The Commission believes, however, that the current policy of writing off interest on
loans for full-time and low-income students while they are studying is not an effective use of the government's
resources. While this policy has decreased the length of time taken to repay loans after graduation, it has also
led to an increase in the number of students taking out loans and in the overall level of student debt. To
compound matters, the policy has made it possible for learners to borrow money and invest it for private gain
(arbitrage). Consequently, the Commission believes that this policy should be discontinued - or that, as a
minimum, the incentives for arbitrage should be removed. Any savings accruing to the government as a result
of modifying the current loan scheme should be reinvested in the tertiary education system and be used for the
benefit of students' (New Zealand Tertiary Education Advisory Committee, 2001, p. 14).
Nicholas Barr April 2002
934.
H OW MUCH EXTRA MONEY ? Suppose graduates pay an interest rate equal to the
government's cost of borrowing rather than, as now, the inflation rate. 10 Do the resulting
savings make the move worthwhile?
35.
Barr and Falkingham (1993, 1996), using LIFEMOD, a microsimulation model, found
that for every 100 the government lends, only about 50 is repaid. Of the missing 50, 20 is not
repaid because of fraud, early death, and emigration (all of which have a relatively small
effect), and mainly because some graduates have low lifetime earnings and so never repay
their loan in full, and 30 is not repaid because of the interest subsidy. In other words, the
interest subsidy converts nearly one-third of the loan into a grant.
36.
Previous sales of student debt offer independent evidence. The debt was sold for
about 50 pence per pound of its face value. Official estimates suggest that of the missing 50
pence about 15 pence was because of low lifetime income, etc., and 35 pence because of the
interest subsidy. The evidence on the interest subsidy is compelling. The government did not
use LIFEMOD; thus the official estimates and the simulation results reinforce each other.
37.
A recent modelling exercise 11 offers further confirmation. The model is conservative
in at least two ways. First, it assumes that the subsidised interest rate is 2.5%, the
unsubsidised rate 5%, thus implicitly assuming that the real rate will stay as low as 21⁄2%
throughout the lifetime of the loan. Second, the accounting of debt forgiveness is on an
accruals basis, even though forgiveness normally occurs only at the end of the loan period. 12
The model takes as its starting point projected loan outgoings for the next academic year of
£2,500 million. 13 With debt forgiveness of 15% (i.e. assuming that 15% of student borrowing
will never be repaid because of low lifetime earnings, etc.), 14 a move to an interest rate equal
to the government's cost of borrowing would release sustainable savings of £700 million per
10
Charging a market interest rate on income-contingent loans raises issues under the Consumer Credit Act.
Solutions to the problem are outlined in Annex 4.
11
The model was originally developed by the Chief Executive of the Student Loans Company as part of a joint
LSE/SLC project advising the Hungarian Government, and has been adapted to simulate alternatives to the UK
system.
12
The calculations assume that a portion of the total debt forgiveness occurs each year, when repayments are
due. This gives a higher assessment of the cost of forgiveness than one which reflects the real life position,
where the level of forgiveness is known only at the end of the repayment period. The cost is higher because
discounting for the loss of purchasing power over time is greater in the earlier years of repayment. The approach
was adopted because it represents the most punitive accounting approach that can be taken for costs, depending
on the resource accounting policy applied by the Treasury.
13
This is the forecast figure for 2002-3 including income-contingent loans, mortgage loans and hardship loans
(the latter two being small). The outturn for 2000-1 was £1840 million, the forecast for 2001-2, £2282 million.
14
New Zealand, with longer experience of income-contingent repayments, uses an official estimate of 10% in its
public accounts.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
10year. 15 That sum could be used to finance additional grants and scholarships of up to £700
million. Alternatively, it could be used to underwrite an expanded loan system; with 15%
debt forgiveness, it would be possible nearly to triple the total amount of lending. Or the sum
could be used for a combination of the two policies.
38.
W HEN WILL THE MONEY BE AVAILABLE ? It is necessary at this stage to distinguish the
cash-flow costs of loans (i.e. the money which is required now, but which will eventually be
repaid), from the fiscal costs (i.e. borrowing which will never be repaid). With the present
loan scheme, for each 100 that students borrow (the cash-flow cost), roughly 50 will never be
repaid (the fiscal cost). The argument above is that eliminating interest subsidies reduces the
fiscal cost of loans from about 50% to about 15%. Though the Treasury will, of course, take
cognisance of cash-flow costs, the abolition of interest subsidies makes it possible to have a
loan system that is larger, but at the same time has smaller fiscal costs.
39.
Seen through the eyes of the Treasury, £700 million is the present value of the annual
saving, and is thus a significant and sustainable long-run resource. Seen through the eyes of
the Department for Education and Skills, however, the initial savings in cash-flow terms are
small. 16 But higher education needs to benefit immediately from the long-run savings. That
will require a deal between the Treasury and the Department for Education and Skills for an
early injection of additional resources. One way to finance such a deal is by selling a further
tranche of student debt, which could yield up to £2 billion. For the reasons explained in the
previous paragraph, such a deal makes sense in both educational and fiscal terms.
40.
Ensuring low fiscal costs is, of course essential. Once that is done, the Treasury can
choose how to deal with the cash flow costs of the loan system. It could do so out of taxation:
under resource accounting, the fiscal costs (i.e. lending that is not expected to come back)
appears as current education spending, while expected repayments appear in the capital
account as a financial asset. 17 With the present loan scheme, about half of lending to students
is counted as spending out of the education budget. If there were no interest subsidy, only
15%, or so, of total lending would appear as current education spending, and the 85%
expected repayment would appear in the capital account.
15
The gross annual saving from a move to an unsubsidised interest rate is £X million, considerably larger than
£700 million. The figure of £700 million is the answer to the following question: the government wants to
finance grants by selling bonds which are repaid after n years, where n is commensurate with the maximum
duration of the student loan; if repayments, including interest, over n years is £X million, what is the maximum
face value of the bonds? The answer is £700 million – the amount that can be spent on grants allowing for the
cost of financing those grants. Thus the figure is a very conservative one.
16
To oversimplify, if the interest rate students pay rises by 2.5%, the extra interest in year 1 is 2.5% x £2500
million, i.e. £62.5 million. In year 2, the saving in cash-flow terms are double that sum, in year 3 triple, etc.
17
Resource accounting has been introduced in the UK only recently. For a description of the way student loans
are treated in the public accounts in New Zealand, which has had resource accounting for longer, see Barr
(1997), evidence to this Committee.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
1141.
Alternatively, the Treasury could deal with the upfront cash flow costs by bringing in
private money to finance the scheme. This can be done in various ways. The debt-sale
approach has been extensively discussed (Barr and Falkingham 1993, 1996). There has been
less exploration of front-end funding, which has two variants. With retail lending, individual
students borrow from private lenders; thus student borrowing is individualized. With
wholesale lending, the loans administration borrows private money in tranches of (say) £2
billion, which it then lends to students. 18
42.
G RASPING THE NETTLE . The scale of the prize is clearly enormous. But political
worries about raising interest rates persist. These, however, should not be exaggerated.
• There is already growing support for removing interest subsidies (e.g. Piatt and
Robinson, 2001).
• Interest rates are currently low; thus the interest rate would have rise by no more than
21⁄2 per cent from the rate in the current loan scheme.
• A person's monthly repayments depend only on her income; thus interest rates have
no effect on monthly repayments, but only on the duration of repayment. Once such a
scheme has been introduced, this feature will become obvious to graduates.
• The wider public should understand who benefits from interest subsidies. Interest
subsidies do not help students (it is not students who make loan repayments, but
graduates); they do not help low-earning graduates, since unpaid debt is forgiven
after 25 years; they do not help higher-earning graduates early in their careers (since
monthly repayments are a fraction of earnings, and so are not affected by the interest
rate); the only people they help are higher-earning graduates in mid career, whose
loan repayments are switched off earlier because of the interest subsidies than would
be the case without the subsidies.
43.
I N SUM .
• Interest subsidies are targeted with exquisite accuracy: they benefit successful
professionals in mid career. Thus the NUS position, defending interest subsidies, is
arguing for continued subsidies for those who need it least at a time when they need it
least, and the hell with today's struggling inner-city sixth-formers.
• Removing the interest subsidy finances policies to promote access and quality, thus
helping students rather than graduates. The proposal is not to eliminate subsidies, but
to replace blanket (i.e. untargeted) subsidies by targeted interventions.
18
There has been extensive development work on front-end funding (see Barr, 2001, Ch. 14). The result is not
just academic theory, but has been extensively tested with the IMF, Eurostat, and financial market actors.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
12•
Income-contingent loans are simply a form of income-tax; and income-tax, together
with a write-off after 25 years, bases loan repayments on outcomes, and hence targets
subsidies accurately on graduates with low lifetime earnings.
Once students and their parents come to understand these point, their worries and, with them,
much of the political hullabaloo, will recede – an issue discussed in detail in paras 63-73.
4 The policy strategy
44.
This section sets out a strategy for access and quality with three elements:
• flexible fees, to address the quality issue, and to begin to free universities from
unnecessary central planning;
• a wide-ranging loan scheme to empower choice for the generality of students;
• wide-ranging but targeted measures to promote access; these need to start early in the
school system.
45.
The three elements are a strategy, not just a bunch of ad hoc policies: they are
designed to achieve explicit objectives, and the elements are mutually reinforcing. This does
not mean that the policies below must be swallowed whole, but does mean that attempts
indiscriminately to pick and mix will fail to achieve the policy's objectives.
4.1 Flexible fees
46.
A MEDIUM - TERM AIM . Flexible fees are both necessary and desirable for at least three
reasons.
47.
To address diversity. Historically, with a small tertiary system and a limited range of
subjects, it was possible for central planners to determine funding levels for different
institutions. Today, however, the higher education system is large, diverse and complex. As
a result, (a) the necessary variation in funding is much greater than formerly and (b) the
problem is now too complex for a central planner to have the sole power of decision about
how resources should be divided between institutions. Thus institutions should have the
freedom to set their own fee levels (that freedom could be constrained).
48.
To arrest quality decline. Without higher fees, quality will continue to be eroded and,
given flat fees, eroded most at the best institutions.
49.
To prevent crowding out. At present, the best institutions tend to receive more
funding for teaching in an attempt to protect their quality. This risks crowding out
universities with a different mission. With higher fees, the best institutions could paddle their
Nicholas Barr April 2002
13own canoes to a greater extent than currently, freeing resources for institutions which have to
do more remedial teaching. Thus – an important and poorly-understood point – flexible fees
benefit all tertiary institutions.
50.
A RGUMENTS THAT DO NOT STAND UP are of two sorts. It is sometimes argued that
students should pay the full costs of tuition. That argument overlooks the significant (albeit
hard-to-quantify) external benefits of higher education. There is a strong case for continuing
taxpayer subsidy for tuition for all students. Other people argue the opposite – that tertiary
education should be entirely funded from taxation. There may be a case for that policy for
sub-university education, but, applied to higher education, the argument is flawed. The
argument that university education should be free at the point of use (which I support), does
not mean that there should be no charges. Free tuition is expensive, and its benefits accrue
disproportionately to people from better-off backgrounds, who go on to be among the best-
off. Thus free tuition is badly targeted; the money could do much more for access if spent in a
way that directed resources specifically at those groups for whom access is most fragile and
those who do not benefit financially from their degrees. Lowering tuition charges for higher
education in other countries has not improved access. Conversely, introducing the Higher
Education Contribution Scheme in Australia in 1989, with tuition charges paid via an
income-contingent loan, did not harm access (Chapman 1997).
51.
H OW HIGH SHOULD THE FEE BE ? Taxpayer support plus tuition fees should cover the
costs of teaching. At research-intensive universities, fees should be higher to the extent of the
value-added in teaching by research-active people, but should not cross-subsidise research.
52.
P ITFALLS TO AVOID . Though flexible fees are desirable, there should be no 'big bang'
liberalisation. As a first step, the flat fee should be increased to £2000. 19 However,
institutions should be free to charge less if they wish, and the ceiling should be raised over
time. As indicated below, any increase in the ceiling should be accompanied by an equal
increase in the loan entitlement.
4.2 A wide-ranging income-contingent loan scheme
53.
The second element in the strategy is a wide-ranging loan scheme. Discussion starts
with policy options and then turns to a much-neglected aspect of loans – how to make sure
that the public understands the nature of the beast.
P OLICY OPTIONS
54.
As explained in section 2, a well-designed loan scheme has four characteristics:
income-contingent repayments; sufficient to cover all living costs and all tuition fees; with
19
See, similarly, Piatt and Robinson (2001) and Council for Industry and Higher Education (2001).
Nicholas Barr April 2002
14an interest rate equal to the government's cost of borrowing; and capable of bringing in
private funds. A loan scheme of this sort opens up the following options.
55.
U NIVERSAL . If there is no interest subsidy there is no need to ration loans, which can
therefore be made available as a universal entitlement. The administratively complex and
politically unpopular means test disappears; so does the relevance of such factors as whether
a student is married or cohabiting.
56.
A DEQUATE . For the same reason, the loan entitlement can be large enough to cover
realistic living costs and all tuition fees. 20 A universal, adequate loan has major advantages.
• It eliminates student poverty.
• It makes higher education free at the point of use.
• It makes it possible to abolish parental contributions.
• It frees students from forced reliance on expensive credit card debt and/or the need for
extensive part-time work, and thus in substantial measure addresses the worries of
middle-class students and their parents, and also the (rightful) complaints by the NUS
about the amount of high-cost student debt.
• It is simple for students and their parents to understand.
• It is vastly simpler to administer than current arrangements, since the administratively
cumbersome and unpopular means test can be abolished.
There is no need to belabour the helpful political resonances of all these features.
57.
E XTENDING LOANS TO OTHER GROUPS OF STUDENTS . The scheme could be extended to
postgraduate students, starting to address worries about research capacity and national
productivity. It could also become a universal entitlement throughout tertiary education,
buttressing existing sketchy student support for further education and vocational training,
thus contributing to access.
58.
P ROTECTING LOW EARNERS is a clear priority. Income-contingent repayments do so
automatically, since low earners make low repayments, and people with low lifetime earnings
do not repay in full. Nevertheless, many people are afraid of rising debt, and interest
subsidies were introduced to assuage those fears. As argued earlier, however, interest
subsidies are a costly, non-transparent and ineffective way of promoting access, and benefit
exactly the wrong people. The policies below are more transparent and better targeted ways
of protecting low earners.
20
Extending loans to cover tuition fees raises issues under EU legislation. These are discussed in Annex 4.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
1559.
Scholarships, i.e. grants which do not carry an obligation to make income-contingent
repayments.
60.
Stopping repayments after 25 years. Scholarships help people at the start of the
process. Complete debt forgiveness after (say) 25 years helps them at the end of the process.
61.
Targeted interest subsidies based on current income. It is also possible to help people
during the process. Under the simplest mechanism, anyone receiving a credit for national
insurance contributions – someone who is unemployed or looking after young children –
receives an interest subsidy. As an extension (as in New Zealand), anyone whose earnings
are so low that his or her income-contingent repayment fails to cover the interest element,
similarly receives an interest subsidy.
62.
Conditional subsidies. The mechanism in the previous paragraph protects low earners
and people with career breaks. However, some of the subsidies benefit people who
subsequently have high earnings. Thus there are advantages in terms of fiscal cost and
targeting to have a system which pays interest subsidies based on current income, but with a
facility to claw back the subsidy element for people who end up with high lifetime income.
A workable such scheme has been designed, which the Student Loans Company could
administer without difficulty. Such a scheme has major advantages: it gives assistance at the
time they need it to people with low income and/or with a career break, facilitating access
and preventing people from worrying that their repayment obligation is spiralling upwards;
but it is cost free, since the clawback mechanism ensures that only the lifetime poor keep the
subsidy. It is also flexible: it would, for example, be possible to give conditional subsidies to
some groups (e.g. someone who went travelling after graduation), but unconditional subsidies
to others (e.g. someone looking after young children or elderly dependants – analogous to
current proposals to assist teachers with their loan repayments).
U NDERSTANDING INCOME CONTINGENCY : SOME EQUIVALENCE PROPOSITIONS
63.
Past failures adequately to explain income-contingent loans has created unnecessary
disquiet. Medical practitioners sometimes talk about 'the worried well' – people who are in
good health, but whose life is made less happy by misplaced worries that they are not well.
Analogously, it can be argued, 'worried debtors' are concerned that student loans will be a
millstone. Students perceive a large debt, but miss two important points of context. First,
repayments are merely an addition to their future income tax. Thus the risk they take is no
different from the risk we all face that at some time in the future the basic rate of income tax
might increase (I am old enough to remember a 33% basic rate). Second, they do not see
how much they will pay over the years in income tax or national insurance contributions, nor
what they will spend on food (or drink) over a 25-year period. None of these items cause
people to worry, despite the fact that someone who starts on average earnings and remains on
Nicholas Barr April 2002
16average earnings all his working life, will pay nearly £300,000 21 in income tax and national
insurance contributions over a 35-year career, a topic discussed more fully in Annex 2.
64.
Alongside the policy design in the previous paragraphs, it is thus imperative to
explain what is going on. I am not at this stage digressing into political presentation, but
want instead to point out some analytical equivalences which should inform explanation.
65.
The following schemes are all analytically identical.
66.
S CHEME 1: AN INCOME - CONTINGENT LOAN . Earlier discussion described an income-
contingent loan, for which graduates make repayments of x% of their earnings until they have
repaid the loan at an interest rate equal to the government's cost of borrowing. What has been
missing thus far in government action is a clear explanation that a person's loan repayments
are, in effect, a form of income tax: a person's repayments track changes in his or her
earnings instantly and automatically, and thus nobody repays more than he or she can afford.
67.
The point is fundamental. Suppose we start from the argument (NUS, etc.) that
higher education should be paid out of taxation. But that means that the costs of higher
education are paid by the generality of income recipients, including low earners, non-
graduates, pensioners, and the like. It is widely acknowledged that this is unfair. To deal with
that unfairness, some people have argued that higher education should be financed through a
graduate tax, which can be thought of as additional income tax, but paid only by the
beneficiaries of higher education. But a graduate tax has its own unfairness, since people
with high lifetime earnings repay considerably more than they have borrowed (this is true of
any successful professional, without having to refer to extreme cases like Mick Jagger or
Stelios Haji-Ioannou). 22 To address the latter problem, it is suggested that a graduate tax
should not have an indefinite duration, but should be capped, i.e. 'switched off' once a person
has repaid an agreed contribution towards the costs of his/her degree. An income-contingent
loan is exactly that – it is a graduate tax which is capped at 100% of the initial sum borrowed.
Put another way, the only difference between a graduate tax and an income-contingent loan is
the duration of repayment: with a graduate tax, repayment lasts (say) 25 years, regardless of
how much a person has borrowed or repaid; with an income-contingent loan the duration of
repayment bears an exact relation to the initial amount borrowed.
68.
Thus income-contingent repayments can be described as repayment of debt. But with
equal accuracy they can be described as a form of targeted income tax – targeted by being
imposed only on graduates and by being 'switched off' once the loan has been repaid. This is
21
In today's prices, assuming annual real earnings growth of 21⁄2%.
22
As explained in Annex 3, a graduate tax has problems in addition to being unfair: it leads inescapably to
continued reliance on public funding; it is a hypothecated tax; and it raises difficult boundary problems.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
17a form of taxation that is more efficient and fairer than funding via the entire body of
taxpayers.
69.
S CHEME 2: FREE HIGHER EDUCATION (C UBIE ). If loans are universal and adequate to
cover all living costs and all tuition fees, higher education is free at the point of use. Thus the
system can be described as free higher education, paid for by a targeted income tax or a
graduate contribution. To repeat, the only difference from tax funding is that (a) the tax is
paid only by those who have been to university and (b) the additional tax is capped.
70.
S CHEME 3: UNIVERSAL GRANTS PLUS A GRADUATE CONTRIBUTION . Suppose that all
students receive a grant large enough to cover their living costs and tuition fees; and suppose
that the system is financed by an extra x pence in the pound added to a person's income tax
rate. The contribution does not go on for ever: it is 'switched off' once a person has
contributed an amount equal to the grant he/she received; and nobody pays for more than
(say) 25 years. Thus the scheme is simple: there is a universal grant, financed by a graduate
contribution payable for a maximum of 25 years, but for some people a shorter time.
71.
Two additional points specify the scheme precisely:
• The duration of the graduate contribution bears an exact relation to the amount of
grant a student has received. Though administratively complex, this is precisely the
task that the Student Loans Company currently performs: higher earners repay their
grant more quickly; lower earners take longer and are further protected in the ways
outlined in paras. 58-62; and nobody makes contributions for more than 25 years.
• Students for whom access is fragile are helped in the ways set out immediately below.
The scholarships and other forms of financial help they receive do not make them
liable for a graduate contribution.
72.
Since the three schemes are equivalent, any is an accurate description of the system of
student support. If this were better understood – particularly the very close relation of
income-contingent repayments to tax funding – the problem of the 'worried well' would be
greatly diminished.
73.
A point in conclusion: the equivalence arguments in the previous paragraphs are
analytical and should be judged on the quality of their logic. They are not presentational
arguments based on logical thin ice.
4.3 Active measures to promote access
74.
Income-contingent loans measure ability to pay on the basis of where a person ends
up, i.e. his or her subsequent income. This is the best approach for students from better-off
Nicholas Barr April 2002
18backgrounds, who are generally well-informed about the benefits of tertiary education.
However, students from socially-excluded backgrounds are typically badly informed.
Precisely for that reason, a wide range of additional measures to promote access – the third
leg of the strategy – is necessary.
75.
Put another way, it is not only financial poverty which impedes access, but also
information poverty. Any strategy for access therefore needs two elements:
• those which involve money, and
• those which involve information and raising aspirations.
The following are no more than indications of the scale of necessary actions.
76.
G RANTS AND SCHOLARSHIPS IN HIGHER EDUCATION . Money measures include
scholarships for students from poor backgrounds. They could be based on parental income,
but should also include money for schools and universities to award to students from poor
backgrounds. There should be financial incentives to universities to widen participation; and
universities would, in any case, wish to gather resources for scholarships to enable them to
recruit the brightest students, regardless of their financial background.
77.
For some students the biggest hurdle is to realise that they are good enough to do well
in higher education: for them, scholarships which make their first year entirely free give
them a risk-free opportunity to test their abilities and to become well-informed about higher
education. Once such a student does well in the first year, he or she will be much more
prepared to take out at least a partial loan for the rest of the degree.
78.
E XTRA PERSONAL AND INTELLECTUAL SUPPORT IN HIGHER EDUCATION . A second
ingredient in promoting access is extra personal and intellectual support, at least in the early
days, for access students to make sure that, once a student starts at university, he or she gets
the necessary support to make the transition. It is no good persuading someone to go to
university if he or she is then allowed to sink without trace.
79.
R AISING ASPIRATIONS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN . Action is also needed much earlier.
Information and raising aspirations are critical. The saddest impediment to access is someone
who has never even thought of applying to university. The sorts of schemes involved include
Saturday Schools, which bring schoolchildren from poor areas to university to study on
Saturday mornings; summer schools, which do something similar during the summer
vacation; visit days, when schoolchildren can visit a university; visits by academics to
schools to make the idea of higher education more tangible; visits by current students, ideally
from the same or a similar school, to schools in deprived areas; and mentoring of
schoolchildren by current university students, preferably from a similar background. Such
activities needs to start early, e.g. at age 12.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
1980.
M ORE RESOURCES EARLIER IN THE SYSTEM . Problems of access to higher education
cannot be solved entirely within the higher education sector. Thus more resources are needed
earlier in the education system, which is where the real barriers to access occur. 23 This
includes more resources for teaching. It also includes financial support for 16-18 year olds.
5 Conclusion
81.
At risk of sounding repetitive, the root of all the funding problems of the present
system go back – directly or indirectly – to the interest subsidy on student loans.
• Interest subsidies aggravate the shortage of resources in the sector, compete with
university funding, cause loans to be inadequate, crowd out expenditure to promote
access, and are deeply regressive.
• Setting the interest rate that graduates pay equal to the government's cost of
borrowing is the key to addressing all these problems and, on a conservative estimate,
yields some £700 million per year. That sum is important for its own sake; it is even
more important because a fiscally cost-effective loan scheme can leverage a much
greater volume of private finance. Specifically, with no increase in long-run fiscal
costs, it would be possible nearly to triple total lending, or to combine a smaller
expansion of loans with additional grant expenditure.
• Grasping the nettle makes possible the policies for access and quality set out in
section 4.
• The move is less difficult than it sounds – perhaps the political equivalent of the
'worried well'. In Sweden and the Netherlands graduates pay an interest rate broadly
equal to the government's cost of borrowing, and the matter is not regarded as in any
way noteworthy; and Australia and New Zealand are currently facing the same reality
as the UK.
• In contrast, if the interest subsidy is not eliminated, we might as well all pack our bags
and go home.
23
Educational exclusion has a clear connection with broader social exclusion – for example, less than 25% of
children in care in the UK end up with any formal educational qualification.

20Annex 1: The student support system before and after 1998
82.
Table 1 summarises in simplified from (and with rounded numbers) the system of
student support for students who started their degree between 1990 and 1997, and that for
students who started their degree in 1998 or later.
83.
The old system was introduced gradually. When fully phased in, it operated through:
(a)
(b)
(c)
84.
50 per cent of student living costs from a mortgage-type loan;
50 per cent of living costs from a mixture of grant and parental contribution;
no tuition fees paid by the student.
The arrangements since the 1998 have three components:
(a)
(b)
(c)
an income-contingent loan;
replacement of the grant by a loan entitlement which is partially income tested; 24
an income-tested tuition fee.
Table 1: Student support: the system until 1998 and the current system
Living expenses
The system until 1998
Tuition
50% mortgage-type loan;
50% grant/parental contribution

'Poor' student 100% income-contingent loan
Free
'Rich' student Parental contribution of 25% of £1000 flat-fee from
living costs; income-contingent parental contributions
loan the rest
The current system
85.
To amplify the current system:
• 'Poor' students (i.e. where parent/spouse net income is below about £18,000 per year)
pay no tuition fee and are eligible for an income-contingent loan intended to cover
100% of living costs.
• 'Rich' students (whose parents' or spouse's net income is above about £34,000 per
year) pay the full £1000 fee. They are entitled to an income-contingent loan equal to
75% of the maximum loan. It is assumed that the parental contribution pays the
tuition fee and 25% of living costs.
• In between, loan entitlement and fees are calculated on a sliding scale. 25
86.
To illustrate these arrangements with a simplified numerical example, suppose that it
is estimated that students need £4000 to cover living costs, made up, under the old system
24
Poor students are eligible for 'a maintenance loan of the same value as the current grant and loan package'
(Hansard, (Commons), 23 July 1997, col. 950).
25
Herein lies much of the complexity – for details, see Department for Education and Skills (2001)

21(line 1 of Table 1) of a loan entitlement of £2000 and grant/parental contribution of £2000.
Thus the maximum parental contribution (for a student not eligible for any grant) is £2000.
87.
Under current arrangements, a poor student is eligible for an income-contingent loan
of £4000 to cover living expenses, and does not have to pay a tuition fee. A rich student
receives £2000 in parental contribution, £1000 to cover the tuition fee and £1000 towards
living costs, and is eligible for an income-contingent loan of £3000 to cover remaining living
costs.

22Annex 2: An unsubsidised interest rate: how much extra for graduates?
88.
What is the effect on repayments if graduates pay an interest rate equal to the
government's cost of borrowing rather than (as currently) the rate of inflation?
89.
A NSWER 1: MONTHLY REPAYMENTS . The change has no effect on a graduate's monthly
repayments. Since loans are income-contingent, repayments depend only a person's monthly
income. Thus the higher interest rate affects the duration of repayments but not the amount
of the monthly repayment.
90.
A NSWER 2: TOTAL REPAYMENTS . On average, it is estimated that students will take
15-20 years to repay their loans (since the system of income-contingent repayments is new,
estimates are all that we have). The model referred to in para. 37, estimates that at today's
prices if a graduate takes 15 years to repay his loan, the extra interest payments on a loan of
£12,000 from removing the interest subsidy is about £3700. The comparable figure if he
takes 20 years to repay is £4700. Thus a plausible estimate of the additional interest
repayments of an average student taking 171⁄2 years to repay is £4250.
91.
S OME COMPARATORS . These numbers need to be seen in context.
• With even a modest graduate premium (15%) and real wage growth (including career
progression) of 5%, a graduate will earn £270,000 more than a non-graduate over a
35-year career. The extra interest payments are a minuscule price for those benefits.
• Over 35 years, a non-graduate on average earnings pays about £520,000 in income tax
and national insurance contributions; with a graduate premium of 15%, the equivalent
figure for a graduate is about £600,000. Thus the additional interest payment is
equivalent to a tax increase of about 0.7%.
• Over the lifetime of the average loan, a graduate will spend on average £25,000 on
alcohol. To spend £25,000 out of after-tax income a person paying basic rate income
tax etc., has to earn £37,000. Thus it would be possible to finance the additional
interest payments by having one booze-free day per week till the loan has been paid
off.
92.
The figures in the previous two paragraphs are in cash terms. The equivalent figures
in present value terms, at a 5% discount rate, are as follows. On a loan of £12,000, the present
value of the extra interest payments is £2,880 over 15 years, or £3,350 over 20 years; thus the
average student will pay around £3,115 in additional interest payments. Over a 35-year
career, the extra earnings of a graduate are £105,000. The present value of the income tax
and NICs paid over 35 years by a non-graduate on average earnings is £195,000; for a
graduate the comparable figure is £228,000. The present value of expenditure on alcohol
over 171⁄2 years by an average graduate is £14,000, requiring pre-tax earnings of nearly
£21,000.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
23Annex 3: An open-ended graduate tax: problems but no solutions
93.
An open-ended graduate tax (i.e. one which is paid for, say, 25 years irrespective of a
person's earnings) creates major problems.
94.
C ONTINUED RELIANCE ON PUBLIC FUNDING . Since a graduate tax is irredeemably a
tax, it cannot be privatised. It merely continues public funding through a different route.
Thus the flow of private finance via graduates’ repayments is slow in coming, and hence does
nothing to improve access or quality in the short term.
95.
Even in the medium term, a graduate tax does not necessarily produce extra resources
for higher education, since increasing flows of private finance in (say) 10 years time can be
offset by reduced public funding. This is exactly what has happened in Australia, whose
Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) was introduced in 1989 with the express aim
of increasing resources for higher education. That aim remains unfulfilled.
'A year-long investigation into Australian higher education by a senate committee has
found the nation's university system in crisis and in need of substantial public
investment over the next ten years.
'The committee found that universities were seriously underfunded and were
worryingly reliant on non-government sources of revenue, notably on fee income
from foreign and local students' (Times Higher Education Supplement, 19 October
2001, p. 10).
96.
In sharpest contrast, a well-designed loan scheme could bring in private funds from
day 1, in ways which avoid these problems.
97.
C LOSES OPTIONS WHICH A LOAN SCHEME LEAVES OPEN . As discussed in section 4,
above, a scheme which avoids interest subsidies makes possible a wide variety of highly
desirable options, such as making higher education free at the point of use – options which
the fiscal cost of a graduate tax entirely rules out.
98.
U NFAIR .
reasons:
A graduate tax is unfair (and hence politically unpopular) for several
• People are compelled to make continuing contributions, with no option to pay upfront
if they wish.
• Those contributions are unrelated to the cost of their higher education.
• The contributions will be considerable for a successful professional, and can be
enormous, e.g. for the Mick Jaggers or Stelios Haji-Ioannous of this world.
99.
H YPOTHECATION . What happens to the revenue from a graduate tax?
• If it is simply another source of income for the Consolidated Fund, it is a tax, pure and
simple, and higher education continues to be publicly funded.
• If it is explicitly dedicated to higher education, it is a hypothecated tax – a mechanism
which (with the exception of the national insurance fund) the Treasury has always
regarded as an anathema. Any such move would be a major policy shift. Such a shift
might be worth discussing if the potential gains are great, but that is not the case here.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
24100. B OUNDARY PROBLEMS . A graduate tax is (a) compulsory (contrast loans, where
students can choose whether or not to borrow), and (b) binary (contrast loans, where students
can choose how much to borrow), and thus creates major boundary problems as between:
• Different occupations. Do all UK students pay the graduate tax? Doctors? Nurses?
Intending teachers? Once a group is granted an exemption, there will be pressure to
extend it, and considerable difficulty in removing an exemption from any group.
• Different modes of study. Does the graduate tax apply equally to full-time and part-
time students? What about Open University students?
• Different parts of the UK. A major problem arises because taxation operates on a UK
basis but the responsibility for higher education is devolved. A graduate tax thus
opens up a Pandora’s box – for example, the Scottish Executive could ask for a
different form of graduate tax, or could opt out altogether. If the graduate tax is not
the same throughout the UK, would an English person who studied in Scotland pay
the English rate or the Scottish rate? Would the answer be the same for a Scot who
studied in England? Ditto Northern Ireland (over half of whose students attend
universities in the Republic of Ireland or the mainland)?
• Different parts of the EU. Does the graduate tax apply to UK graduates who studied
in other EU countries (or elsewhere); and how are EU students at UK universities
treated?
101. All these boundary problems raise major practical problems for the tax authorities as
well as creating a potential political minefield.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
25Annex 4: Legal issues
I NCOME - CONTINGENT LOANS AND THE C ONSUMER C REDIT A CT
102. Though income-contingent student loans are not made under the Consumer Credit Act
(CCA), it is desirable that they stay as close as possible to the Act and to other relevant
financial legislation.
103. The problem is as follows. Under the CCA, loan agreements have to specify interest
charges across the life of the contract. That is possible only if the repayment flow is known.
This is not a problem for a conventional (mortgage-type) loan, but is not possible with
income-contingent loans, where repayments depend on a person's (unknown) future income
stream and hence have an unknown duration. The issue was sidestepped in 1997/8 by
arguing that the current student loan, which is indexed to the retail price index, is below the
low interest threshold for the CCA. 26 Since that threshold is low, an unsubsidised loan would
almost certainly exceed it, if not now, then at some time in the future.
104.
There are two potential avenues to resolving the problem;
(a) revise the CCA to accommodate income-contingent loans; or
(b) ensure that the legislation bringing in new student support arrangements explicitly
excludes those arrangements from the CCA via Statutory Instrument.
Approach (b) presents no obvious problems: a loan which charges the government's cost of
borrowing is within the spirit of the CCA; the process in (b) is simpler and quicker than (a);
and it leaves it open subsequently to amend the CCA if the government so wished.
L OANS FOR FEES AND COMPLIANCE WITH EU LEGISLATION
105. At present, UK students are eligible for a loan which covers (part of) their
maintenance, but not their tuition fees. If loans covered fees, it would be illegal to deny loans
to students from other EU countries studying in the UK. 27 A court case is currently testing
whether it is legal to deny such students access to maintenance loans. In considering the
coverage of loans, the following points are relevant.
106. Loans to cover fees are highly desirable because they make higher education free at
the point of use. Thus the issue of EU-compliance should be addressed in the medium term;
and it might have to be addressed in the short term even for maintenance loans, depending on
the outcome of court case mentioned above. The problem should not be exaggerated. The
loan contract that students currently sign entitles them to income-contingent repayments
while within the UK tax net, but requires them to make mortgage (or similar) repayments if
26
The England, Wales and Northern Ireland Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 (THEA 1998), s.22(4)
and s.22(9) provide that Secretary of State may only charge compound interest rates required to maintain the
value in real terms of the outstanding amounts of the loan, which shall at no time exceed the 'specified rate for
low interest loans'. This 'specified rate for low interest' is defined in s.22(9) as the rate specified for exemption
purposes under s.16(5)(b) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (CCA 1974). The Scotland Teaching and Higher
Education Act 1998, s29 inserts amendments to the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, (ESA 1980). The ESA 1980
s.73B(6) includes the same provision as s.22(9) of the THEA 1998, and therefore defines the low interest rate as
a rate that will ensure exemption under the CCA 1974.
27
The post-Cubie arrangements in Scotland, by ensuring that students face no upfront charges, in effect extends
loans to cover fees, thus raising serious problems of compliance with EU law.
Nicholas Barr April 2002
26they work abroad. This process is already embedded in the procedures of the Student Loans
Company and works well. In the short run it could be extended to EU students.
107. A better starting point is to note that foreign students are a good thing, not a bad thing.
Higher education is – and should continue to be – a major UK export industry whose benefits
are both direct (income from overseas students) and indirect (future UK exports). A properly
designed loan scheme is self-funding apart from non-repayments from the lifetime poor,
which introduce a social policy element into the scheme. Extending the scheme to EU
students is thus feasible on the basis that each government agrees to cover the social policy
element of loans for its own citizens.

One of the prevailing concerns for prospective students worldwide – at graduate level and otherwise – is funding. With many countries still seeing rising tuition fees, alongside cuts to government-funded financial aid, obtaining sufficient funding and managing debt are often the biggest obstacles facing students who wish to pursue further education.

To start with, the cost of graduate study can be overwhelming simply to work out. Depending on the location and your circumstances, you may need to account for some or all of the following: tuition fees, semester fees, student services fees, course material expenses, food, travel, accommodation, visa and health insurance costs, childcare and personal expenses. For some, there’s also the “opportunity cost” to calculate, meaning the cost of time spent taking a career break.

The good news? While costs are in many cases higher than ever, leading universities and national governments are focusing on ways to increase funding opportunities and their accessibility.

Sources of graduate funding

It is advisable to start looking for graduate funding opportunities while or even before applying to universities, as the two processes often require very similar applications. In general, applications for funding need to be submitted by spring if you’re starting study in the fall of the same year.

Fortunately, there are many types of funding available for graduate students: merit-based, need-based, need-blind, university-specific, course-specific, subject-specific, career-specific, demographic-specific, country-specific, ability-specific and non-specific… The following is a breakdown of the most common types of graduate funding available around the world.

Home- and host-country governments
The first places to check for funding opportunities are the Ministry/Department of Education in your home and host countries. International students may not be eligible for all government funding schemes in the host country, so it’s important to thoroughly check opportunities in your home country first. Globally, typical government-funded aid includes sponsorships, loans, grants, scholarships (also known as studentships in the UK when referring to PhD students) and bursaries, each with distinct rules regarding eligibility, deadlines, application procedures and amount of funding awarded.

Universities and higher education institutions (HEIs)

Many universities and other HEIs offer some sort of financial aid for international students, be it fellowships, scholarships, grants, awards or bursaries, distributed on the basis of need, academic merit or both. Funding information is usually available online – check the scholarship or international section of the university website. Apply to as many schemes as possible, but remember to check the criteria carefully to ensure you fit the requirements. While highlighting your strengths and any exceptional achievements are a given, those applying for graduate study should also draw attention to any research projects, academic events, papers or conferences to which they have contributed, as well as discussing future research plans.

Scholarships

Scholarships are prestigious, highly coveted and usually the hardest form of financial aid to secure. They don’t need to be repaid and cover the full or partial costs of tuition, sometimes along with a portion of living costs. Scholarships are usually based solely on academic merit, although there are also many specialized scholarships which are targeted at students with certain backgrounds, interests, skills or ambitions. For example, sporting scholarships for the athletically gifted are particularly common in the US, and you don’t have to be on a sports-related course to apply. Discover scholarships by country and subject here.

Teaching and research assistantships
Assistantships (also known as studentships in the US) provide funding for postgraduate students in exchange for time spent working in a teaching or research role. They may be funded by the university department or your supervisor’s research budget, or by an external funding body with vested interests in a particular field of development. Rarely offered for professional degrees such as the JD, MBA or MD, often a requirement for PhD programs, and particularly common in STEM subjects, assistantships are cost-effective for the university and provide valuable teaching and/or research experience for the student.

Students with an assistantship are obliged to carry out specified teaching and/or research activities, stipulated in a contract. In return, you’ll typically receive a modest salary and/or a waiver of your tuition fees. Some universities may also provide funding for field trips and conference participation. When working in this capacity, make sure to remain within the constraints of your student visa, which may specify some employment restrictions.

Charities, trusts, learned societies and special interest groups
Charities, trusts, learned societies and special interest groups often dedicate a portion of their budget to fund graduate studies. While some organizations target specific and niche demographics, many focus simply on students from lower income backgrounds, those experiencing particular financial difficulty, and/or those with demonstrable academic excellence. Usually awards are made for a year at a time, with renewal possible, and students can secure backing from multiple organizations.

When applying for funding, focus on anything that makes you particularly distinctive. Points to highlight include: the relevance and potential future applications of your research; any ways in which your interests and/or background align with those of the funding organization; any disadvantages or challenges you’ve faced, along with your drive to succeed and potential to do so.

Employer contributions

If you’re starting your postgraduate studies after a period of work, you may be able to persuade your employer to sponsor your education. Most companies are supportive of staff training and development, and may even have a budget set aside for the personal and professional development (PPD) of their employees. Professionals requiring further education to become fully qualified include accountants, architects, engineers, social workers, lawyers and teachers.

Employers will be more receptive to your request if you show your aim is to improve your ability in the workplace, advance your career prospects, and/or aid your long-term development within the company, rather than simply indulging your own academic or personal interests. If you do use this route, you may need to sign an agreement which will tie you to the company for a specified period after graduation (usually one to two years).

Student and professional development loans

Dedicated student loans typically have lower repayment rates than regular loans. While common in North America for graduate studies, they are harder to obtain in countries like the UK, which concentrate on providing student loans mainly at undergraduate level. However, a possible alternative is a professional development loan. In the UK, banks offer Professional and Career Development Loans (PCDLs) for students who intend to work in the UK, EU, Norway, Liechtenstein or Iceland upon graduation. The loan funds up to two years of study, covers course fees and some living costs, and has more flexible repayment terms than a regular bank loan.

National research councils
National research councils (RCs) are often the main public-sector distributors of investment in research, including that conducted by postgraduate students. In the UK, there are seven RCs offering competitively sought-after graduate funding covering a wide range of disciplines. Elsewhere, similar investors include the European Research Council for EU countries, the National Research Councils in the US and Canada, the various institutes within the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) in France, the Australian Research Council (ARC), and the German Research Foundation (DFG).

Eligibility criteria usually stipulate residency within the country where the council is based, a good bachelor’s degree and/or relevant work experience. Funding may provide partial or full fee coverage, along with a cost of living grant (known as a stipend), which is usually tax-free. Competition is intense, but highly specialized subjects typically have fewer applicants. You will usually need to apply via the university, rather than directly to the council.

Alternative graduate funding options
While graduate funding options are plentiful, they are greatly outweighed by the number of students vying for those opportunities. In addition to the fierce competition involved, these traditional funding routes are also not guaranteed to cover the full costs of graduate study – so creative candidates may consider some alternative avenues:

Peer-to-peer lending
A form of crowd-sourcing whereby private loans are given to individuals without the mediation of an official financial institution, peer-to-peer (P2P) or social lending provides funding for a variety of endeavors. Specialized online platforms are often used, with some (such as GraduRates.com and StudentFunder.com) focusing on the student market. While the lending is unsecured and you may need a solid credit history, P2P lending is more flexible in terms of repayment and interest rates for the borrower, while lenders have the opportunity to invest in a project or career they believe in. It can also provide a more formalized structure when lending among families and friends – turning a favor into a business transaction.

Portfolio funding

Portfolio funding involves securing small amounts of money from multiple sources. This can mean applying for all the types of funding mentioned in this article, or sending dedicated letters to a range of sources simultaneously. For this, students prepare a fundraising pack, with a letter asking for help in funding their degree. The letter explains who they are, what they want to study and why, what they will give back (either to the individual they address, or society as a whole) and how to make a donation.

Student jobs

If you intend to use a student job to supplement your finances, remember that each country has its own rules about whether, where and how international students can work. Typical restrictions include limited working hours during term-time, and rules about whether you can work off-campus or need to stick to jobs within the university. For example, international students in Canada must obtain the Off-Campus Work Permit (OCWP). Most campuses offer many opportunities for part-time work, including working in a shop or café, in the student union, as an organizer or helper at university events, in an administrative role, or as a student tutor or advisor. You could also consider freelance work as a tutor, capitalizing on skills in fields such as languages, sports, arts or music.

Part-time study
You might also consider enrolling for part-time study, which will mean your tuition fees are spread out over a longer period, while you have more time to work alongside your course commitments. If this is your plan, make sure you have a realistic balance between work and studies. If you do find yourself struggling to cope, your university’s student support team may be able to direct you towards funding opportunities that have opened up since the commencement of the academic year, or at the very least, help you find a better balance or schedule.

1. Introduction 
Since the expansion of higher education began to take place in China in 1998, the scale of higher education has been increasing rapidly, leading to a gigantic number of students and a much tougher employment situation for the graduates. Thus, the Policy of College Students Can Suspend Study to Start Up Businesses was formulated and promulgated against the background of increasingly tense employment situation for college graduates, which concerns vast

numbers of people and different classes and has huge influences over a country’s economy, technology, national defense and society, etc. 
The aim of this paper is to try to analyse, from the perspective of the backgrounds of the problem and related national policies, how the problem of “College students can suspend study to start up businesses” was qualified to be a public problem and a pubic policy problem according to the micro-procedures of public policy making, as well as how final policies were made and are being implemented and make some suggestions in the end. 
2. General Situation 
The academia circle normally considers the definition of public problem put forward by Cobb and Elder in 1983 authoritative—“Public problems are neither simple established facts nor problems reflecting the status quo, but are still explaining and societal definition situations.” Therefore, the definition of public problem and it itself are by no means objective, with them neither a linear nor a determinative but a dynamic process. The problem of college graduates’ employment is a public problem that has been attracting wide attention and concern from the people, the government and our country, so it is both a realistic and social problem. At present, the situation is by no means more optimistic, with more graduates than needed and the competition from the past graduates and oversea returnees. The declining education quality is also to blame, with quite a few college students being unable to meet the demands and standards set by their employers or find jobs that match their majors. 
If left unattended without any measures to be taken by relevant parties, the problem will definitely incur serious consequences. Firstly, people’s trust in higher education will be reduced, resulting in less enthusiasm about investing in higher education. Worse still, higher education will likely be undermined because it has to cater to the market and employment demands (Cui Yuting, Zhao Fanghui, 2010) [1]. 
Secondly, college graduates are supposed to become major groups of consumers, so their having trouble finding jobs will also hinder our country’s domestic consumption policy from progressing smoothly. Thirdly, constant complaints and dissatisfaction from college students and their parents who constitute a large portion of the entire population will pose potential threats to our society, crimes and disruptions of riots (Wang Wei, 2004) [2]. 
Therefore, with all that has been mentioned above, we can see the problem of college students’ employment is also a public policy problem, because a public problem important enough to attract attention from the government and concern and anxiety from vast majority of ordinary people can become a public policy problem (Xie Ming, 2010) [3]. Some people even chose to protest against the relevant departments or the government in a less pleasant manner. Meanwhile, frequent media reports also serve as a strong catalyst. More importantly, its solution lies within the government’s capability, which guarantees it the pos

T. Jiang, F. Zhou 
sibility of turning the solution into a public policy. 
Actually, the State Council Office forwarded the Ministry of Education’s NOTICE in Mar. 2002, which stipulates that relevant departments should simplify the formalities, increase working efficiency and actively support entrepreneurship of college students. Emloyment-guiding courses should be opened to enhance college students’ ideological and political education, to help them form the concept of selecting jobs by themselves, starting up their own businesses and taking seeking employment seriously. 
Therefore, it is apparent that the public policy problem of college graduates’ employment garnered great attention from a long time ago from the Ministry of Education, which has also contributed to the formulation and promulgation of relevant policies supported and approved by the State Council. It was under this circumstance that College Students Start Up Their Own Businesses became one of the most preferred measures taken to alleviate employment pressure and solve related problems in this regard. 
3. Analysing from the Micro-Procedure of Public Policy 
Making 
However, public problems possess the characteristics of complexity, unclear structure, dynamism, multiple-conclusiveness and polytrope, with dynamic evolution the most fundamental one. Every element or system comprising a public problem is changing and evolving with every second passing by in not mechanic and linear but a non-linear way. Meanwhile, every element or system is influencing other elements or systems, making a public problem constantly evolve in a non-linear way as time goes by (J. W., 2003) [4]. 
A public policy problem is one that concerns almost every individual at a certain period of time, that is, a public problem is closely linked to the cognition, values and interests of every individual. This implies that the natural, ecological, social, historical and psychological factors will all be embedded into a public problem just like that of an individual. Furthermore, all the factors above are intermingled with each other. Therefore it is extremely vital to know and analyse the new characteristics and nature of the public policy problem of College Students’ Employment in this modern era, which, to a great extent, determines whether a scientific, effective and successful policy will be made. Here in this paper, the work is done from the perspective of the micro-procedure of public policy making. 
3.1. The Nature of a Policy Problem 
3.1.1. Complexity Just as stated above, a policy problem is scarcely an isolated, unilateral and purely one-aspect problem. It is a chaotic mess. Likewise, the policy problem of College Students’ Employment is definitely closely connected with the social background. economic development, population, people’s cognitive ability, interests and demands, etc at a given period of time.

T. Jiang, F. Zhou 
1) Population: In recent years, the number of college students enrolled across universities and colleges in China has been increasing rapidly. There were some 6.8 million college graduates in 2012, 6.99 million in 2013, while the number reached 7.27 million in 2014 and 7.49 million in 2015 (China Youth Daily, 2014) [5]. Obviously, the increasing number means greater employment pressure, which made it even more essential and urgent to formulate and promulgate better and more effective policies. 
2) Society: College students’ entrepreneurship-related policies have been attracting enormous attention and heated debated among the society. As time goes by, people’s perception of entrepreneurship has changed remarkably. With increasing reports from media and relevant departments covering inspiring entrepreneurship and successful cases, the general public’s old notion of holding a stable job or “Golden bowl” is not as deeply rooted (Xinhua News, 2012) [6]. As a matter of fact, more people nowadays have changed their attitude towards entrepreneurship, with the interpretation of “labeling it as misconduct” changed into “it being a symbol of an entrepreneur”. In addition to a more tolerant attitude, the support and encouragement from the society also creates a sound environment and atmosphere for college students’ entrepreneurship. 
3) Provincial and municipal universities and colleges: More and more province and city-level universities and colleges have improved their related measures, providing more professional and reliable entrepreneurship guidance for college students. For instance: The entrepreneurship act in Zhejiang University is not initiated by individuals but by teams, thus making up for the shortcomings of starting up businesses by merely individuals. Meanwhile, the approach of combining the integrated strengths of student entrepreneurs on campus and mentors outside the campus has also proved effective and popular, with celebrities from the province and others from the business circle nationwide contributing, such as Mr. Xu Xiaoping and Mr. Yu Minhong from New Oriental, the co-founders of China’s biggest private language training school (Zhang Baomin, 2013) [7]. 
In terms of the school educational system, Zhejiang University also adopted a more flexible one that allows students who are starting up their businesses to be absent from classes and learn by themselves or through teachers’ instructions and take the exams in the end. There is also the practice of lengthening the school educational system that allows students to finish their study from 4 years to 6 years. Such attempts as this have also been adopted in quite a few other universities nationwide to benefit students. 
For instance, in Jan. 2013, the Shandong Provincial Government published a document, in which it encourages universities and colleges in the province to allow their full-time students to Start Up Businesses while suspending studies temporarily. Furthermore, similar policies had been announced in Tianjin City 
DOI: 10.4236/jss.2017.58022 275 Open Journal of Social Sciences 
T. Jiang, F. Zhou 
and Jiangsu Province, etc. Quite a few successful cases of entrepreneurship have also proved that actually starting up businesses and study are not contradictory with each other (Xinhua News, 2012) [6]. 
4) Economy: After 2014, Chinese economy shifted towards the New Normal, changing from “High growth” to Medium-high growth and “Improve quality, and make progress while ensuring stability”. 
3.1.2. Human Factors Policy problems can also be said to be results of people’s subjective judgments. Different countries have different criteria due to the different national circumstances, different cultural values and perceptions, different experience and methods. Therefore, people in different countries will resort to different explanations according to their specific needs. 
1) Dynamism The feature above thus leads to a policy problem being dynamic, with its content and solutions changing with the advancement of time and space. 
2) Historic influence A public policy problem doesn’t just occur abruptly but rather is a product of the development and evolution of another problem with all its history and basis playing an important role (David A. Rochefort and Roger W. Cobb., 1993) [7]. 
So it is fair to say that any new public policy problem is the derivative of a past problem, or one created by the changes in the environment and other elements. Naturally, the theory also applies to the problem of “College students’ employment”. After the first series of policies supporting college students’ starting up their businesses have been in place for more than 10 years, the problem has undertaken some new features and characteristics, thus resulting in a new public policy problem. 
Admittedly, the policies supporting college students’ independent entrepreneurship emerged from none to some, then developing in quantity and quality. Apart from relevant policies, the number of related courses and services initiated by universities and colleges has been increasing. For instance, quite a few universities have established venues for practising entrepreneurship, such as Exemplary Base of Entrepreneurship within campus, and Entrepreneurship Garden to provide a practice platform for college students’ independent entrepreneurship. It is also a fact that the traditional idea of employment of college students has changed and that their awareness of starting up businesses has been stimulated, with their desire for entrepreneurship more intense and motivation more robust. However, despite all this, there still exist many problems in this regard. For instance, there is still great room for improvement in these policies ,which will still inhibit students from starting up their businesses. There are still problems with the arrangements of relevant courses and lecturing. The college students are not well prepared enough. The social participation is relatively low so it is hard to put certain activities into practice. The number of college graduates in 2014 
DOI: 10.4236/jss.2017.58022 276 Open Journal of Social Sciences 
T. Jiang, F. Zhou 
was 7.27 million, reaching a historic new high. However, the effects of employment-targeted entrepreneurship policies and a series of other supportive measures were little. According to the vice minister of the Bureau of Human Resources and Social Security, Mr, Xin Changxing, the percentage of students choosing to start up their businesses only accounted for 1 percent of the total, a far smaller figure compared with those of other countries (China Youth Daily, 2014) [5]. 
Of course, in the process of constructing a public policy problem, the constructing methods are very critical. Dunn believes that “the constructing method of a public problem comes ahead of the solutions, ... in that the former is more advanced in essence.” (William N. Dunn., 2004) [8] For instance, Supposition Analysis, Boundary Analysis, Brainstorming Analysis and Cause-Effect Analysis as well as SWOT Analysis approaches can be adopted. 
3.2. Affirming the Goals of the Policy 
Promulgate and put into effect more effective national policies supporting college students’ independent entrepreneurship and further enhance their interest and awareness, improve their capabilities of starting up businesses and innovation to increase the general employment rate and promote the economic and technological development of our country. 
3.3. Drafting, Assessing and Selecting Proposals 
Special agencies and specialists in the areas of education, management, administration, economics and sociology, etc can be gathered to work on the procedure with large amounts of research work to be done in advance. Different proposals should be made to serve as alternatives and the screening of these alternatives is a process of identifying the best one based on a full assessment of these alternatives. 
3.4. The Legitimization of the Policy 
After screening the alternative proposals comes the final round of deciding on the best one, which is conducted on the basis of assessment and proof of the alternative proposals. The screening procedure is the prerequisite for deciding on the final best one, a strict procedure that must be completed by the authoritative department with the final step to be accomplished by the top legislature through voting. What’s worth attention is that after the legitimization of the policy, communication, implementation and assessment work of the policy should be conducted (Anders Hanberger, 2001) [9]. The communication work of a public policy refers to the act of coordinating different stakeholders in the process of promulgating and implementing the policy to achieve the preset goals. The implementation of a policy mainly focuses on the implementing situation of the legitimate policy to achieve the goals. Once inadequate implementation or poor effects are discovered which will prevent the goals from being met, adjustments 
DOI: 10.4236/jss.2017.58022 277 Open Journal of Social Sciences 
T. Jiang, F. Zhou 
and urgent measures should be adopted. The assessment of a policy refers to the assessing of the performance and value of the promulgation, implementation, functioning, effectiveness, effect, efficiency of the policy as well as public feedback. The main assessment approaches include: Investigation, survey, Data analysis, All-around assessment, Sample assessment, General investigation, Individual interview, and Public poll. 
4. Analysis of the Effects of the Policy 
4.1. The Advantages of the Policy 
4.1.1. College Students’ Starting up Businesses Is Good for Employment The employment pressure for college students has been increasingly tense in recent years, thus becoming a major concern in society. The phenomenon that graduation means being out of employment is common and the phenomenon of boomrang kids(young people who are not currently engaged in Employment, Education or Training but rely on their parents for a living) is also gathering momentum. The policy that College Students Can Suspend Study to Start Up Businesses can relevantly improve employment in that it allows students to participate in social practices in advance, integrate what they learned in the practices with campus study after their return, bringing the synergy of theory and practice to the maximum and not only helping solve their own employment problems but also creating job opportunities for others (Cui Yuting, Zhao Fanghui, 2010) [1]. 
According to statistics, the number of college students involved in starting up their own businesses kept climbing consecutively from 2014 to 2016. The number of college students who started up businesses in 2014 was 478,000,597,000 in 2015 and 615,000 in 2016. 
4.1.2. The Policy Is Conducive to Cultivating Students’ Independence and 
Innovative Capabilities Exam-oriented education has made quite a few students lack the ability to live, work and learn independently and rely on teachers and parents’ intensive care because they simply lack the ability to get things done by themselves, not to mention to be innovative. 
4.1.3. The Policy Is Beneficial for Cultivating Personalized Talents and 
Promoting the Process of Educational Modernization A flexible school system enables the students to choose flexible schedules and different learning approaches in order to balance between study and entrepreneurship. Every student can choose different subjects to complete credit requirement according to their own specific needs and preferences, thus avoiding the previous homogeneous, monotonous and rigid education model that everyone has to accept. 
4.2. The Disadvantages of the Policy 
Though a flexible school system can provide students with the possibility of ba
DOI: 10.4236/jss.2017.58022 278 Open Journal of Social Sciences 
T. Jiang, F. Zhou 
lancing both study and entrepreneurship, many problems still exist at this initial stage of implementation, such as: concrete arrangements of curriculum, credit arrangements and school system arrangements, etc. Furthermore, a school system and curricular arrangement that are compatible with the policy should be very well-conceived ,which also takes time to test, verify and improve. 
The policy might become the excuse for students to drop out or lose interest in study and academic research. As a matter of fact, there have been some students who are frequently absent from classes deliberately under the pretext of engaging in their businesses while lowering their standards for academic courses, with many asking for a pass for exams. 
Things have proved that some disciplines have advantages in terms of entrepreneurship, such as Electronics, E-commerce, Design and some creativity-related majors. These majors require relatively smaller fund to start up a business and cover wider ranges of projects, and have relatively lower thresholds for the resources accumulated, thus becoming very popular choices for college students who want to start up their own businesses. However, students in some other majors, such as English, may find it harder to establish a business in that the majors themselves restrict the areas the students can enter or the market demand for these areas have greatly decreased. The standards for other majors, such as Finance and Law, of starting up a business in the sector are higher than the students can meet. Even though some of them may manage to start up a business, it is difficult to press ahead and make accomplishments. What follows failures will most likely be a waste of money, time and energy, and worse still, frustration and even pessimism. 
According to a survey conducted by a newspaper to 850 college students,237 of them have thought about starting up their businesses; 204 plan to get involved after graduation; Only 20 of them are currently engaged in entrepreneurship, most of them in networking and catering industries as part-timers; The rest simply don’t know much about the College Students Can Suspend Study to Start Up Businesses Policy. Even after being informed of the policy, only 63 are supportive of it while 92.6% say they will never make the choice of suspending their studies to start up a business. 
5. Suggestions 
5.1. The Government 
The Ministry of Education should promulgate more supportive laws and regulations and urge all universities and colleges involved put relevant policies in place. The local governments should streamline administration and distribute power to the lower levels, be more supportive of college students’ entrepreneurship, provide more preferential policies to reduce obstacles and difficulties for college students who want to start up their businesses. For instance, the central and local government can mobilize social forces to set up some entrepreneurship bases to serve and aid the students, providing them with funding, projects and

T. Jiang, F. Zhou 
guidance. 
5.2. Universities and Colleges 
Universities and colleges should properly optimize their curriculum and provide a variety of lecturers on entrepreneurship through different channels and from all-around angles. They should play a leading role at the initiating stage and make reasonable and specific course arrangements for students involved in entrepreneurship according to students’ needs. In addition, college institutions can also invite experienced experts regularly to give guidance and training to the students, as mentioned in the paper of the practice already adopted by some universities. 
5.3. The Public 
People’s perception of entrepreneurship should be changed. As stated previously, traditionally, most people hold the notion that students’ only task is to work hard and that they shouldn't spend time on unrelated things in college. However, people’s perception needs to be changed under different social backgrounds and more tense employment situation. Therefore, young people should be encouraged to enter the society bravely. In this regard, the media and communities can help spread the new perception to the public and attract their attention and support. 
Meanwhile, parents should also view suspending study to start businesses rationally and provide help in the process when necessary. 
5.4. Students 
Students should make their own sound judgments about entrepreneurship and shouldn’t follow the mainstream blindly. Not everyone is suitable to try the initiative. Once decisions have been made, the practitioners should take advantage of their own strengths, enhance the learning of related knowledge and actively seek for valuable entrepreneurship projects. At the same time, they can also learn from experience and practices of other students or entrepreneurs. Therefore, suspending study to start businesses doesn’t mean ceasing learning but keeping learning and holding a good and earnest attitude. 
6. Conclusions 
It would be reasonable for different students to carefully decide, depending on their individual case, whether they want and are able to suspend their studies to start up a business. While the intention of the policy is good, not every student is fit and eligible for it. Prior to making the decision, one should get as much information as possible on the essence, spirit, requirements and qualifications needed and rationally analyse if he or she is qualified enough to leave campus and be a social member temporarily. It would be unwise to just follow the mainstream or merely long to escape from college life and become a so-called entre

preneur. 
Though the Policy “College Students Can Suspend Study to Start Up Businesses” has been put into effect and is being implemented, the problems of college students’ employment and entrepreneurship can’t be solved by merely a document. It takes time before problems on the ensurance, procedure and effects of implementation can be observed. At the same time, the government should also continue relevant studies, come up with specific supportive laws and regulations to make the policy more consistent and sustainable and realize the goal of benefiting those following the policy to a greater extent.

However, despite the efforts made, many studies reveal the persistence of important problems, related in particular to the increase of regional disparities and importance of inequalities in access to school between boys and girls. However, the Moroccan education system still has a low student performance, with high dropout and repetition rate and moderate level of secondary schooling. This can be partially explained by several factors including household income, the characteristics of the labor market, rural and urban distribution, parental education, etc. Public policy could also be the cause of the problems plaguing the country’s education system. This study aims to test the validity of the effects of three public policy instruments (basic infrastructure, management, and direct aid) on the enrolment rate for pre-school, primary, secondary and college levels. To conduct this study, we retained 27 variables which concern three categories: product, result and impacts. A principal component analysis (PCA) had been carried out from 2002 to 2012, in order to identify the most statistically correlated variables with enrollment rates. Then, a regression models with panel data were used to test the relevant effects of public policy on enrolment rate by level. The results indicate the presence of statistically significant effects of the basic infrastructure on increasing enrolment rate, especially the number of classrooms and the staff. Keywords: educative policy, econometric panels 1. Introduction Morocco has made significant progress in increasing access to education and implemented a great number of strategies, which had contributed to improve schooling rates in primary, collegial and secondary levels. In this regard, it is important to underscore the evolution of education policies, which started the first years after independence by the adoption of unification, moroccanisation, generalization and arabisation principles. It developed thereafter by the implementation in 1973 of training teachers programs and by a global reform aimed to facilitate access to education for disadvantaged groups at the beginning of the 1980s. In 1994, a new phase based on opening of the school to its environment, the involvement of new participant and the rationalization of resources began. The creation of regional academies and the implementation of the National Charter marked the culmination of this phase. As results, the net enrolment rates have improved appreciably at the national level and in urban areas. In return, the disparities between females and males and between urban and rural areas have increased, affecting the student’s performance. This can be partially explained by several factors including household income, the characteristics of the labor market, rural and urban distribution, parental education, etc. Public policy could also be the cause of the problems plaguing the country’s education system. This study aims to examine the effects of educational public policy on the schooling rates and to present the trends of education indicators in Morocco. In particular, it articulated to evaluate if the construction of schools and the strengthening educational staff were appropriate feeding choices around education public policies. This will make it possible to draw lessons about the suitable policies required to improve the quality and efficiency of 214 www.ccse education The rema The educ presentati The last c 2.

Second, the financing of the education system has also grown, with an increase of the share of the budget devoted to public spending on education. The most recent data show that Morocco has surpassed all comparator countries with a share of around 24.8% (Figure 1). As results of these efforts, the primary education rates increased appreciably and its generalization is close. From 59% in 1980, it rose to 97% in 2012, with a very small difference between places of residence. The improvement was particularly observed for the rural girl’s enrolment rate which has more than quadrupled between 1990 and 2011, rising from 22% to 96% of children of age group (Figure 2). It should also be noted that the repetition and dropout rates were very low in the primary education, not exceeding 8% and 3% in 2012. The completion rate is high at almost 86%. 100 80 6096,49 96,04 96,93 4073 2059 45 0Enrollment rate (%) Girls' enrollment rate (%) Boys enrollment rate (%) 1980 2012 Figure 2. Enrolement rate at the primary Source: Ministry of Education, World Bank. By contrast, the secondary school enrolment rates remain modest and heterogeneous. Thus, at the college level, the net enrolment rate of children aged between 12 and 14 years, does not exceed 53.9% , with significant differences between regions and gender (girls enrolment rate is 23.6%in rural areas against 78.7% for urban). Similar results were obtained in the qualifying secondary, where the rate does not exceed 28% in 2010/2011 for children aged between 15 and 17 years. In addition, a very large disparity between medium of residence is registered (5.4% in rural areas, 5.6% for boys and 5.1% for girls). The lack of school infrastructure, roads and transport in some areas makes access very difficult to school. Moreover, the quality of secondary education (college and qualifying cycles) remains low in Morocco, taking account of a completion rate in both cycles of 65% and 37.5%, respectively (Table 1). Table 1. Indicators of education, 2008-2012 2008-2009 2009-2010 2010-2011 2011-2012 Primary education Repetition average rate 12,3 12 9,3 8,2 Drop-out average rate 4,6 3,3 3,1 3,2 Completion rate 76 83 86,5 86,2 Collegial Repetition average rate 15,2 16,1 16,3 16 Drop-out average rate 13,1 12,9 10,8 10,4 Completion rate 52 57 64,6 65,3 Qualifying Repetition average rate 19,2 18,8 18,1 17,1 Drop-out average rate 14,1 11,9 9,2 11 Completion rate 26 30 36,2 37,5 Source: Ministry of Education. In view of the results, it’s no surprise that the average years of schooling in Morocco are not high. It should be recalled that the length of schooling was below 6 months (0.4 years) in 1960. Over the following fifty years, the average number of years of schooling for population aged of 15 and over has increased gradually to reach 5 216 www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Vol. 7, No. 4; 2015 years in 2010. This gain is less than that recorded in the comparator countries and the rest of the Arab countries. Overall, the efforts of successive governments had contributed in an improvement of education, especially in the primary level, but many gaps remain important. In fact, the literacy level is relatively low compared to referent countries, show average rate of over than 90%, with the exception of Tunisia, where the level is around 79%. In addition, statistics show the persistence of inequalities between men and women in literacy. Significant disparities are also detected between areas: illiteracy affects 39% of the total population aged of 10 years and over, 50% of rural population and 65% of rural women. 4. Methodology and Data The study pertains to a sample of the sixteen regions of the kingdom, covering a period from 2002 to 2012. 27 variables classified into three levels: outputs, outcomes and results have been identified and have undergone specific treatments. Data were collected from the Ministry of Education. The choice of the specification models is framed by the content of the logical framework and theoretical evaluation commonly accepted and internalized the arguments of the educational production function. Annex 1 presents the theoretical specifications of education indicators with an indication of expected signs. Explanatory variables included in the final statistical model were selected by an iterative procedure; which involves conducting successively the following steps: • Step 1: identify, among the explanatory variables, those having a theoretical link with results variables; • Step 2: conducting a principal components analysis (PCA) so to retain the independent variables, being more empirically correlated with results, varying among those short listed in step 1. The calculation of correlations is, in addition, leads to some potentially relevant variables products in conjunction with some result indicators; • Step 3: specify model panel data regressions, which identifies the explanatory variables and check the existence of regional differences (fixed or random effects models). We used for this purpose, Hausman test. • Step 4: modify non-relevant specifications and retain parsimonious model that presents a satisfactory degree of explanation that a recursive method for each variable. This exercise was conducted through a review of the parameters, their signs and analyzing statistics like the Student and the Fischer tests, R2 (Within ...). Econometric specifications adopted allow highlighting the relationship between the dependent variables and the explanatory variables. The specification that is applied takes the following functional form: Y = F (W) With Y: results variables vector for education and W: explanatory variables vector. Using panel models and data of the sixteen regions, we examined the relationship between the determinants of result indicators for education. This review captures the effects of regional differences in the development of education expressing the priority objectives of public policy. These include the: • Preschool enrolment rate; • Primary enrolment rate; • Collegial enrolment rate; • Qualifying secondary enrolment rate. 5. Presentation of Results This is to combine a simple descriptive analysis based on the calculation of the average rates of education indicators between two periods with the results from econometric panel data treatment, in particular when regional differences exist. It proves that the inclusion of "the effect of the regions’ sheds light on the behavior of education between each region. 5.1 Preschool Enrolment Rate Preliminary analysis of data related to the phase between the periods 2002-2008 and 2009-2012, marked by the implementation of the Emergency Plan for Education, shows a slight improvement in preschool average enrolment rate. The latter increased from 53.3% to 62.3% at the national level. Regionally, the most remarkable finding concerned the regions of Oued Ed-Dahab-Lagouira, Laayoune-Boujdour-Sakia the Hamra, Guelmim Smara, Great Casablanca and Meknes-Tafilalet, with a fall of around 10 points. Thus, we propose to test whether a public policy aimed at improving basic educational infrastructure in the preschool had encouraged households to enroll their children in preschool. It is, in this case, to assess how extent of the number of classrooms and education personnel staff has been in contributing to improving education and whether these variables are causing an increase in the preschool rate of in the regions. 217 www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Vol. 7, No. 4; 2015 The model results confirm the significant effect of the number of classrooms in improving the preschool enrolment rate, with a sign closely aligned with the expected. The higher the number of preschool classrooms, the greater is the gross preschool enrolment rate. Specifically, an increase in preschool classrooms by one unit leads to an improvement by 0.005 points in the preschool average enrolment rate. Table 2.

Regionally, this slight increase was marked the whole of Morocco’s regions, with the exception of Souss-Massa-Draa and Taza-Al Hoceima-Taounate regions. Identifying the factors behind this improvement of the primary enrolment rate by reference to public policy requires specific models. Thus, we are interested to assess whether the development of the educational infrastructure in rural and urban areas, increase of teachers and supervisors in both medium and development of school canteens could promote higher enrolment of children in primary school. It arises that most relevant variables, which explain the primary enrolment rate, are in the order as follows: the number of primary schools and the staff ratio in urban areas, the support rate, the school canteens and the number of rural primary schools in rural medium. In addition, their signs compared to the net primary enrolment rate are in conformity with what is expected in theory. Specifically, an increase by one unit of the number of primary schools in the urban areas leads to a raise by 0.06 points of the net primary enrolment rate. In addition, it should be noted that an expansion by one point of the supervision rate in the urban areas generates a gain by 0.197 point of the net primary enrolment rate, while a one point increase of the rate framing the rural environment results in a relatively important effect (0.213 points). Finally, a rise by one unit of the school canteens in rural areas creates a strengthening by only 0.001 points of the net primary enrolment rate. Having identified the determinants of the primary enrolment rate, we can explain the results recorded in all www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Vol. 7, No. 4; 2015 regions of Morocco except for the Souss-Massa-Draa and the Taza-Al Hoceima-Taounate, where the parameter of the constant is important. The parameters are more remarkable in the southern regions of Morocco: Region 2 and Region 3 with the value of parameters around of 5971 and 2765 respectively. Table 3.

At regional level, the increase is noticeable in the regions of Laayoune-Boujdour-Sakia, Great Casablanca and the Rabat-Salé-Zemmour-Zaer. Conversely, relatively low rates were recorded in other regions of Morocco. By adopting the same procedure for assessing the role of public policy in improving college completion, we evaluated the effects of educational infrastructure and providing incentives such as grants, scholarships and school canteens ... ) on the net collegial enrolment rate. The results of econometric models allows for the identification of the most relevant explanatory variables classified as follows: number of urban settlements, number of internal, number of the school canteens in rural areas. These relevant variables also show signs aligned to the expected results. Indeed, an increasing of the number of establishment by one unit (establishment) contributes to a gain by 0.057 points of the net collegial enrolment rate, while a rise of the number of the internal by one unit boosts the net collegial rate enrolment by 0,002 points. Moreover, the strengthening of the number of beneficiaries of school canteens in rural areas by one unit, leads to an expansion by 0.156 points. Note, however, that the only non-relevant variable in this model was the number of fellows, which has been rejected by the appropriate tests. As for the primary, the Hausman test results served to retain the fixed effect model, which is expected given that Morocco behaviour of school children by region is not the same. It is introducing improvement of R2 coefficient www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Vol. 7, No. 4; 2015 (Within) from 0.35 to 0.94. Public policy factors identified above explain the good results in the regions of Laayoune-Boujdour-Sakia, Great Casablanca and the Rabat-Salé-Zemmour-Zear. Table 4.

Thus, at national level, the rate increased from 16.3% to 25.8%. At regional level, some improvements are visible in the regions of Oued Ed-Dahab-Lagouira, Laayoune-Boujdour-Sakia the Hamra and the Great Casablanca. For the other regions, this rate does not exceed 36%. As a reminder, the comparison of the average net enrolment rate in qualifying secondary per period and region, aimed to identify trends varying results explain by reference to econometric models and to identify factors driving these trends. The analysis of the model results show that the suggested variables such as the number of facilities has a sign consistent with what is expected, while the variables “rate of urban and rural management are not relevant although their signs were closely aligned with what is expected,. Overall, an increase in the number of establishments by one unit generates an increase of 0.269 point of the net enrolment rate in qualifying secondary. This could be explained by the significant deficit in the constructions of specialized institutions at secondary level. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the effect of the number of institutions affects positively the net enrolment rate at the secondary qualifying differently from one region to another (cf. fixed effects expressed by constant related to the regions). These determinants explain the good results recorded in regions 2, Laayoune-Boujdour-Sakia the Hamra with a value of the constant around 7784, Region 9, the great Casablanca www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Vol. 7, No. 4; 2015 with 22,141. By contrast, the least favorable results are recorded in region 4, the Souss Massa Daraa with a value of the constant around 47,832. Table 5.

Conclusion Morocco has invested heavily in education in recent years. This commitment by the Moroccan government has materialized through the development sector funding programs, as also evidenced by the increase in the share of the budget allocated to public expenditure in education at all levels. In addition, we noted also the effect of the implementation of public policies supporting these funding, including the launch of an Emergency Plan, in 2009, in order to enable the achievement of the objectives of the National Charter of Education and training (NECS). From our analysis, it emerges that public policies, focused on increasing the personnel, the number of school canteens and boarding schools, have significant positive effects on primary school enrolment, mainly because of shortfalls in the matter, considered more important the construction of schools. At secondary level, where the deficit in basic infrastructure is important, the effect of increasing the number of constructed facilities is crucial. To conclude, this analysis highlighted the positive effect of educational public policy. However, public efforts should be maintained to generalize education especially in rural areas and improving its performance through an acceleration of the sector basic infrastructure development programs. It is also useful to greater synergy and coordination between public and private operators in order to assess policies and adequate education strategies that could promote a significant improvement of the Moroccan education system and its performance on a medium-term horizon.

Notice of maternity leave should be given at least one month prior to the leave.  9.4.4. Maternity Leave is to be taken at least two weeks prior to confinement.  9.5. Annual Leave  9.5.1. All non-teaching employees with permanent appointment are entitled to 14 days earned  leave besides the allotted calendar holidays with pay and allowances within the year, provided  they have completed eleven months of service in the College.  9.5.2. Non-teaching staff may take the annual leave together or in two/three broken periods, but  only within the period of College holidays. Those who have not completed eleven months service  at the time of the College holidays, may be given proportionate leave.  9.5.3. Annual leave (earned 14 days leave) is to be sanctioned after taking into account the  essential services in the College.  9.5.4. Annual holidays can be availed in parts during the long study leave, puja holidays or  Christmas holidays with prior written permission obtained well in advance. All non-teaching staff  in a department cannot be given long holidays at the same time, as their services are required for  running the College smoothly.  9.6. Public Holidays  9.6.1. Generally all College holidays are holidays for the teaching staff while not so for non-  academic staff. Teaching staff can be asked to attend special classes for students, updating  courses, in-service training or other College related activities during such holidays.  9.6.2. The non-academic staff will follow a list of holidays published annually by the College for  them.  9.6.3. Due to the nature of their work, for those who cannot avail of the full day a week and other  public holidays, other compensatory arrangements may be made.  9.7. Study Leave  9.7.1. Study leave with benefits is permitted only for those with the status of permanent  appointment.  28  9.7.2. With the prior sanction of the Governing Body, a study leave not exceeding 10 days may be  sanctioned to faculty members who are appearing for an examination to further their qualification.  9.7.3. The same may be extended to the non-teaching staff for an examination, sanctioned by the  College, which will enhance the individual’s performance or general proficiency.  9.8. Special Leave  9.8.1. Special leave without pay for advanced study or foreign travel or other purposes can be  permitted by the Governing Body to permanent employees who have completed 10 years of  service in the College.  9.8.2. The maximum period of this special leave is one year and is permitted only once during  their service in College.  9.8.3. These leaves (study leave and special leave) will have to be applied for, at least three  months in advance and must be approved by the Governing Body.  9.8.4. Non-class days specially study leave for students or non class days due to special situation  like public strike etc. can be availed for academic progress when the college does not have  specific work assigned; however a detailed report must be submitted on joining back and the fruit  of the study will be the intellectual property of the college for its publication or academic  requirement as the work is done while on duty; the person concerned gets the authorship and it  may be published by the individual with due permissions from the college.  9.8.5. Attending seminars, foreign travels, taking up responsibilities/jobs of a public nature  without written permission is considered a misconduct.  9.8.6. A staff member on special leave shall not be entitled to increment if the same falls due at  the time when S/he is enjoying the special leave.  9.8.7. Leave without pay may be sanctioned in special situations as per request of the individual  and the need of the college assessed by the Governing Body; however making the clarifications  regarding benefits of increment, gratuity, PF or any other.  9.8.8. A register for the leave account of every employee shall be maintained in the Registrar's  office.  10. SUPERANNUATION/TERMINATION OF SERVICE  10.1. The retiring age for academic staff is 62 years and for clerical and non-academic staff is 60  years.  29  10.2. A permanent employee may resign from the service of the College with three months’ prior  notice or payment of three month's salary amount to the college,  10.3. Governing Body may terminate the service of a permanent employee by giving three  months’ prior notice or three months’ salary in lieu of notice. Here salary shall mean the basic  pay.  10.4. A temporary or probationary employee may resign or his/her services may be terminated by  giving one month’s prior notice or one months’ salary in lieu of such notice, without assigning  any reason whatsoever.  10.5. An employee convicted by a court-of-law on a criminal charge will be terminated without  notice or salary in lieu of notice. An employee against whom a criminal case is registered will not  be allowed to continue in the service of the College till acquitted. If acquitted the period will be  considered part of service, but no salary will be paid for the period, unless the case was registered  by the College itself.  10.6. An employee may be deemed to have terminated his/her services with the College by way  of voluntary abandonment of service if s/he without any intimation /or without any sanction from  the Competent College authority, does not report for duty at his/her place of work for a period of  fifteen (15) continuous calendar days. In the event of such voluntary abandonment of services by  an employee, the College shall be at liberty to take such action as it may deem necessary for  breach of the conditions of service against such an employee.  10.7. On resignation or termination, all dues to the employees, upon any recovery to be made by  the College, will be cleared within seven days after the resignation or termination becomes  effective. This, however, does not apply to the Provident Fund, which are realised when these  amounts are disbursed by the Competent Authority.  10.8. Permanent and probationary employees, on leaving the service of the College are entitled to  a certificate of service as well as a certificate of release from duty.  10.9. Return of College Property: Before leaving the service of the College, an employee shall  return to the College in good order and condition, all properties or equipments including  documents, papers, and files belonging to the College. The cost of any equipment or property not  safely returned shall be deductible from the employee’s salary or other amounts due to her/him on  any account or shall be recoverable otherwise, and the employee shall be responsible for all costs  and consequences thereof.  30  10.10. If any employee is in occupation of any residential premises provided by the College,  whether College owned, arranged or leased, shall immediately upon termination of his  employment with the College, hand over to the College the vacant possession of the premises. If  not it may be recovered by any process of eviction considered appropriate in such circumstances  by the management. The final clearances of dues shall be settled only once the matter is settled.  11. MISCONDUCT  11.1. General  11.1.1.

Abstract Policy evaluation is an essential step in most reinforcement learning approaches. It yields a value function, the quality assessment of states for a given policy, which can be used in a policy improvement step. Since the late 1980s, this research area has been dominated by temporal-difference (TD) methods due to their data-efficiency. However, core issues such as stability guarantees in the off-policy scenario, improved sample efficiency and probabilistic treatment of the uncertainty in the estimates have only been tackled recently, which has led to a large number of new approaches. 
This paper aims at making these new developments accessible in a concise overview, with foci on underlying cost functions, the off-policy scenario as well as on regularization in high dimensional feature spaces. By presenting the first extensive, systematic comparative evaluations comparing TD, LSTD, LSPE, FPKF, the residual-gradient algorithm, Bellman residual minimization, GTD, GTD2 and TDC, we shed light on the strengths and weak- nesses of the methods. Moreover, we present alternative versions of LSTD and LSPE with drastically improved off-policy performance. Keywords: temporal differences, policy evaluation, value function estimation, reinforce- ment learning 
1. Introduction 
Policy evaluation estimates a value function that predicts the accumulated rewards an agent following a fixed policy will receive after being in a particular state. A policy prescribes the agent’s action in each state. As value functions point to future success, they are im- portant in many applications. For example, they can provide failure probabilities in large telecommunication networks (Frank et al., 2008), taxi-out times at big airports (Balakr- ishna et al., 2010) or the importance of different board configurations in the game Go (Silver et al., 2007). Such value functions are particularly crucial in many reinforcement

learning methods for learning control policies as one of the two building blocks constituting policy iteration. In policy iteration, an optimal policy is obtained by iterating between the value prediction for states (and sometimes actions) given the agent’s current policy, that is, policy evaluation, and improving the policy such that it maximizes the value of all states predicted by the current value function, that is, policy improvement. Policy-iteration-based reinforcement learning has yielded impressive applications in robot soccer (Riedmiller and Gabel, 2007), elevator control (Crites and Barto, 1998) and game-playing such as Check- ers (Samuel, 1959), Backgammon (Tesauro, 1994) and Go (Gelly and Silver, 2008). For sufficiently accurate value function estimates, policy iteration frequently converges to the optimal policy. Hence, a reliable and precise estimator of the value function for a given policy is essential in reinforcement learning and helpful in many applications. 
However, obtaining accurate value function estimates is not a straightforward supervised learning problem. Creating sufficient data for obtaining the value function by regression would require a large number of roll-outs (state-action-reward sequences) in order to acquire the accumulated reward for each considered state. As the variance of the accumulated reward frequently grows with the time horizon, exhaustive number of data points would be required. To circumvent this issue, the idea of bootstrapping has been proposed, that is, the current estimate of the value function is used to generate the target values for learning a new estimate of the value function. In expectation, the sum of the current reward and the discounted value of the next state should match the value of the current state. Hence, their difference becomes an error signal for the value function estimator. The resulting approaches are called temporal-difference methods from their introduction in Sutton (1988). Temporal- difference methods have received a tremendous attention in the last three decades and had a number of important successes including the ones mentioned in the previous paragraph. 
While temporal-difference methods have been successful, they have not been under- stood well for a long time (Tsitsiklis and van Roy, 1997; Schoknecht, 2002), they were data-inefficient (Bradtke and Barto, 1996) , and were not stable if used with function ap- proximation in the off-policy case (Baird, 1995). In the off-policy scenario, the value function is estimated from a data set that was generated from another policy than the one we want to evaluate, which is crucial for data re-use in policy iteration. Recently, there has been a large number of substantial advances both in our understanding of temporal-difference methods as well as in the design of novel estimators that can deal with the problems above. These methods are currently scattered over the literature and usually only compared to the most similar methods. In this survey paper, we attempt at presenting the state of the art combined with a more comprehensive comparison. 
This survey has two major contributions. First, we are going to present a principled and structured overview on the classic as well as the recent temporal-difference methods de- rived from general insights. Second, we are comparing these methods in several meaningful scenarios. This comprehensive experimental study reveals the strengths and weaknesses of temporal-difference methods in different problem settings. These insights on the behavior of current methods can be used to design improvements which overcome previous limita- tions as exemplified by the alternative off-policy reweighting strategy for LSTD and LSPE proposed in this paper. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sections 1.1 and 1.2 introduce the required background for this paper on Markov decision processes and value functions. As the paper aims at complementing the literature, especially the book

Figure 1: Stationary Distributions for Different Policies. The MDP has deterministic tran- sitions depending on the state (1 or 2) and the action (solid or dashed) illustrated by the arrows. Taking for example the dashed action in state 1 moves the agent always to state 2. A policy which always chooses the solid action leaves the agent always in state 1, that is, dsolid = [1,0]T, while the dashed counterpart makes the agent alternate between the two states (ddashed = [12, 12]T). If the agent takes the solid action with probability α, the steady state distribution is given by dα = [12 + 12α, 12 − 12α]T. 
by Sutton and Barto (1998), we illustrate the concept of temporal-difference methods for policy evaluation already in Section 1.2. In Section 2, we present a structured overview of current policy evaluation methods based on temporal differences. This overview starts out by presenting the core objective functions that underlie the various different temporal- difference-based value function methods. We show how different algorithms can be designed by using different optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent, least-squares methods or even Bayesian formulation, resulting in a large variety of algorithms. Further- more, we illustrate how these objectives can be augmented by regularization to cope with overabundant features. We present important extensions of temporal-difference learning in- cluding eligibility traces and importance reweighting for more data-efficiency and estimation from off-policy samples. As Section 2 characterizes methods in terms of design decisions, it also sheds light on new combinations not yet contributed to the literature. In Section 3, we first present a series of benchmark tasks that are being used for comparative evalua- tions. We focus particularly on the robustness of the different methods in different scenarios (e.g., on-policy vs. off-policy, continuous vs. discrete states, number of features) and for different parameter settings (i.e., the open parameters of the algorithms such as learning rates, eligibility traces, etc). Subsequently, a series of important insights gained from the experimental evaluation is presented including experimental validation of known results as well as new ones which are important for applying value-function estimation techniques in practice. The paper is concluded in Section 4 with a short summary and an outlook on the potential future developments in value-function estimation with temporal differences. 
1.1 Notation and Background on Markov Decision Processes 
The learning agent’s task is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) M = (S,A,P,R). At each discrete time step t = 0,1,2..., the system is in a state st ∈ S and the agent chooses an action at ∈ A. The state of the next time step is then determined by the transition model P : S×A×S → R, that is, P(st+1|at,st) is the conditional probability (density) for transitioning from st to st+1 with action at. After each transition, the agent receives a reward rt = R(st,at) specified by the deterministic reward function R : S×A→ R. We distinguish between discrete systems and continuous systems. While continuous systems

have infinitely many states (and actions), discrete systems are usually restricted to a finite number of states. For notational simplicity, we mostly treat S and A to be finite sets in the remainder of this paper. Nevertheless, the analysis presented in this paper often generalizes to continuous/infinite state-spaces. 
The behavior of the learning agent within the environment, that is, the action-selection strategy given the current state, is denoted by a policy π. A stochastic policy π : S×A→ R defines a probability distribution over actions given a state st. The agent samples from π to select its actions. Stochasticity of the policy promotes state exploration, a key component of robust policy learning. However, in certain cases a deterministic policy can be easier to handle. Such a policy can be treated as a deterministic function π : S→A with at = π(st). While we also consider episodic Markov decision processes in examples and experiments, we concentrate on ergodic MDPs for the formal part to keep the theoretical analysis concise. Ergodic Markov decision processes do not terminate and the agent can interact with its environment for an infinite time. Their underlying stochastic processes have to be ergodic, which, in highly simplified terms, means that every state can be reached from all others within a finite amount of time steps (for details and exact definitions see for example the work dof π the over of process S Rosenblatt, with being dπ(s in 1971). ) = state ∑s,a If s when P(s these |s, following assumptions a)π(a|s)dpolicy π(s). hold, π, This that there distribution is, exists sampled a stationary yields states the from distribution probability the MDP with policy π are identically distributed samples from dπ. While they are not (necessarily) independently drawn, ergodicity ensures that the strong law of large numbers still holds. Formally, MDPs do not need to have unique limiting distributions. Instead, a distribution defined as dπ(s) = Eπ,P[∑∞t=0 1{st=s}] would suffice in most cases. For fixed policies π, we can rewrite the definition dπ more concisely as dπ(s) = EPπ[dπ(s)], where Pπ denotes the state transition distributionPπ(st+1|st) = ∑at 
P(st+1|at,st)π(at|st). 
Marginalizing out the action reduces the MDP to a Markov chain. Even though the actions are marginalized out, the policy affects Pπ and, thus, the stationary distribution is highly dependent on π. See Figure 1 for an example. 
Reinforcement learning aims at finding a policy that maximizes the expected (total dis- counted) future reward

Policy Evaluation with Temporal Differences 
The discount factor γ ∈ [0,1) controls the considered timespan or planning horizon. Small discount factors emphasize earlier rewards while rewards in the future are becoming less relevant with time. 
A common family of iterative reinforcement learning algorithms for finding the optimal policy is policy iteration. Policy iteration algorithms alternate between a policy evaluation and a policy improvement step (see Figure 2). In the policy evaluation step, the value function V π : S → R for the current policy is estimated. The value function corresponds to the expected accumulated future reward

given that the process started in state s, and that the actions are chosen according to policy π. Hence, the value function evaluates the policy in each state. It allows the subsequent policy improvement step to obtain a policy which chooses actions that move the agent most likely in states with the highest values. 
1.2 Problem Statement: Efficient Value Function Estimation 
This paper discusses different approaches to estimate the value function in Equation (1) while observing the agent interacting with its environment. More formally, the problem of value-function estimation can be defined as follows: 
The value function of a target policy πG and a given MDP M is estimated based on the data set D = {(st,at,rt;t = 1...tf),(st,at,rt;t = 1...tf),...} sampled from the MDP M and a behavior policy πB. The data set D may consist of one or more roll- outs (st,at,rt;t = 1...tf). We distinguish between on-policy estimation (πB = πG) and off-policy estimation (πB = πG). The latter scenario is particularly appealing for policy iteration, as we can re-use samples from previous policy evaluation iterations for the current value function. 
To illustrate major challenges of value-function estimation we consider a classic 2D grid- world example shown in Figure 3, a simple benchmark task often used in reinforcement learning. To estimate the value of the agent’s position, we have to compute the expectation in Equation (1). We can approximate this value directly with Monte-Carlo methods, that is, take the average of the accumulated reward computed for several roll-outs starting from this position (Sutton and Barto, 1998, Chapter 5). However, the variance of the accumulated reward will be huge as the stochasticity of each time-step often adds up in the accumulated rewards. For example one roll-out may yield a high reward as the agent always moves in the directions prescribed by the policy, while another roll-out may yield very low reward as the agent basically performs a random walk due to the transition probabilities of the MDP. Hence, even if we have a model of the MDP to simulate the agent until future rewards are sufficiently discounted, the value estimate of Monte-Carlo methods is typically highly inaccurate in any reasonable limit of roll-outs. 
The crux is the dependency of the state value on future rewards, and subsequently on the state after many time-steps. The problem simplifies with decreasing discount factor γ and reduces to standard supervised learning for γ = 0 (estimate immediate reward E[rt|st = s]). Bootstrapping is an approach to circumvent the problems of long-time dependencies using 
813 
Dann, Neumann and Peters 
a recursive formulation of the value function. This recursion can be obtained by comparing Equation (1) for two successive time-steps t and t + 1 
V π(s) = EP,π[r(st,at) + γV π(st+1)∣∣∣∣st = s]. (2) 
This so-called Bellman equation1 holds true for arbitrary MDPs M, discount factors γ and policies π. This basic insight allows us to update the value estimate of the current state based on the observed reward rt and the value estimate for the successor state st+1. In the long run, the estimate is changed such that the difference of the values of temporally subsequent states (temporal difference) matches the observed rewards in expectation. This bootstrapping approach is the foundation for efficient value-function estimation with temporal-difference methods, as it drastically reduces the variance of the estimator. Yet, it may also introduce a bias (cf. Section 2.1). 
To simplify notation we will write V π as a m = |S| dimensional vector V π which contains V π(si) at position i for a fixed order s1,s2,...sm of the states. Using the same notation for the rewards, that is, Rπ ∈ Rm with Rπi = Eπ[r(si,a)], the Bellman equation can be rewritten as 
V π = Rπ + γP πV π =: T πV π. (3) 
Here, the transition matrix P π ∈ Rm×m of policy π contains the state transitions probabili- ties P πij = ∑a P(si|sj,a)π(a|sj). As we can see, the Bellman equation specifies a fixpoint of an affine transformation Tπ : Rm → Rm of V π (Bellman operator). We will omit the policy superscripts in unambiguous cases for notational simplicity. 
The depicted world in Figure 3 consists of 15 × 15 = 225 states, that is, we have to estimate 225 values. Yet, such a small world can only be used for highly simplified tasks. More realistic settings (such as street navigation) require much finer and larger grids or have to allow arbitrary continuous positions s ∈ R2. This requirement illustrates another inherent problem of value estimation, the curse of dimensionality, that is, the number of states |S| increases exponentially with the number of state variables. For example, if there are several moving objects in our grid world, the number of states |S| explodes. In a 15 × 15 grid world with one agent and 9 moving objects, we have to estimate (15 × 15)10 ≈ 323 values. Thus, we almost always need to resort to approximation techniques for the value function. The simplest and most common approach is a linear parametrization with parameter vector θ ∈ Rn, that is, 
V (s) ≈ Vθ(s) = θTφ(s), where φ(s) defines features of the state s. 
The feature function φ : S → Rn reduces the number of parameters which we need to estimate from m to n with n ≪ m but comes at the price of less precision. Hence, the choice of a feature representation is always a trade-off between compactness and expressiveness, where the latter means that there exists a Vθ that is close to V for all states. 
Estimation techniques for alternative parametrizations of V exist, such as non-linear function approximation (e.g.„ see non-linear versions of GTD and TDC, Maei, 2011, Chap- ter 6) or automatically built representations (cf. Section 2.3). However, defining non-linear

function approximations by hand requires domain knowledge to an extent that is usually not available and the learning problem typically becomes non-convex, that is, the estimator may get stuck in local, but not global, optima. Therefore, this paper focuses on more commonly used linear function approximation. 
After having identified temporal differences and function approximation as the key in- gredients for efficient policy evaluation, we can concentrate on important properties of value function estimators. In robotics and many other fields, the data gathering process is very costly and time consuming. In such cases, algorithms need to be data efficient and yield accurate estimates already after few observations. In other applications, accurate models of the learning environment are available and observations can be generated efficiently by sim- ulation. Hence, the focus is shifted to efficiency in terms of computation time. Computation time is also a limiting factor in online and real-time learning, which require to update the value estimations after each observation within a limited time frame. 
2. Overview of Temporal-Difference Methods 
Value estimation can be cast as an optimization problem, and, in fact, most temporal- difference methods are direct applications of optimization techniques. Hence, their charac- teristics are largely determined by (1) the chosen objective or cost function, and (2) how this function is optimized. We start by discussing different optimization objectives in Section 2.1 that build the basis of most theoretical results and define the quality of the value estimates

after enough observations. In Section 2.2, we introduce temporal-difference methods by grouping them according to the employed optimization technique as algorithms within a group share similar convergence speed and computational demands. To avoid cluttered no- tation and to put the focus on their intrinsic characteristics, we present the algorithms in their basic form and omit eligibility traces and importance weights for the off-policy case here (these are discussed in Section 2.4). Complete versions of the algorithms with available extensions can be found in Appendix C. 
Reliable value estimates are the result of fruitful interplay between expressive feature de- scriptors φ and suitable estimation algorithms. Yet, choosing appropriate feature functions poses a hard problem when insufficient domain knowledge is available. Several approaches have been proposed to simplify the generation and handling of features for temporal-difference methods. We review these recent efforts in Section 2.3. Finally, in Section 2.4, we discuss two important extensions applicable to most methods. The first extension are eligibility traces, which reduce bootstrapping and may increase convergence speed. Subsequently, we discuss importance reweighting for off-policy value-function estimation. 
2.1 Objective Functions 
We are interested in estimating parameters possible to the true value function V π. θ that yield a value function V θ as close as This goal directly corresponds to minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) 
MSE(θ) = Vθ − V π 2D = 
∑mi=1 
dπ(si)[Vθ(si) − V π(si)]2 
= [Vθ − V π]TD[Vθ − V π]. (4) 
The weight matrix D = diag[dπ(s1),dπ(s2),...,dπ(sm)] has the entries of the stationary distribution dπ on the diagonal and weights each error according to its probability. The true value function V π can be obtained by Monte-Carlo estimates, that is, performing roll-outs with the current policy and collecting the long-term reward. However, the Monte-Carlo estimate of V π requires a lot of samples as it suffers from a high variance. 
The high variance can be reduced by eliminating the true value function V π from the cost function. To do so, we can use bootstrapping (Sutton and Barto, 1998), where V π is approximated by a one-step prediction based on the approximated value-function. Hence, we minimize the squared difference between the two sides of the Bellman equation (3) which corresponds to minimizing 
MSBE(θ) = Vθ − TVθ 2D. (5) This objective, called the mean squared Bellman error, can be reformulated in terms of expectations using Equation (2) 
MSBE(θ) = 
∑ni=1 
dπ(si)[Vθ(si) − EP,π[r(st,at) + γVθ(st+1)|π,st = si]]2 
= Ed[(Vθ(s) − EP,π[r(st,at) + γVθ(st+1)|π,st = s])2], (6) where the outer expectation is taken with respect to the stationary distribution dπ and the inner one with respect to the state dynamics P of the MDP and the policy π. Let δt denote

the temporal-difference (TD) error which is given by the error in the Bellman equation for time step t 
δt = r(st,at) + γVθ(st+1) − Vθ(st) = rt + (γφt+1 − φt)Tθ, (7) with φt = φ(st). Equation (6) can then be written concisely as MSBE(θ) = Ed[EP,π[δt|st]2]. Using the second form of δt from Equation (7) to formulate the MSBE error as 
MSBE(θ) = Ed 
√ TMSBE(θ) 
ΠT √ MSPBE(θ) ΠTVθ 
[((EP,π[γφt+1|st] − φt)T θ + EP,π[rt|st])2] 
makes apparent that the MSBE objective corresponds to a linear least-squares regression model with inputs γEP,π[φt+1|st] − φt and outputs −EP,π[rt|st]. However, we actually cannot observe the inputs but only noisy samples γφt+1 − φt. The least-squares regression model does not account for this noise in the input variables, known as error-in-variables situation (Bradtke and Barto, 1996). As we will discuss in Section 2.2.1, this deficiency requires that two independent samples of st+1 need to be drawn when being in state st, also known as the double-sampling problem (Baird, 1995). Hence, samples generated by a single roll-out cannot be used directly without introducing a bias. This bias corresponds to minimizing the mean squared temporal-difference error (Maei, 2011) 
MSTDE(θ) = Ed,P,π[δt 2] = Ed[EP,π[δt2|st]]. (8) 
The square is now inside the expectation. This cost function has a different optimum than the MSBE and, hence, minimizing it results in a different value function estimate. 
Another possibility to avoid the optimization problems connected to the MSBE is instead to minimize the distance of the projected Bellman operator, also called the mean squared projected Bellman error (MSPBE). The Bellman operator in Equation (3) is independent of the feature representation, and, hence, TV θ may not be representable using the given features. The MSPBE only yields the error which is representable with the given features 
817 
Dann, Neumann and Peters 
and neglects the error orthogonal to the feature representation. Most prominent temporal- difference methods such as TD learning (Sutton, 1988), LSTD (Bradtke and Barto, 1996), GTD (Sutton et al., 2008) and TDC (Sutton et al., 2009) either directly minimize the MSPBE or converge to the same fixpoint (Tsitsiklis and van Roy, 1997; Sutton et al., 2008, 2009). The MSPBE is given by the squared distance between V θ and the representable function ΠTV θ that is closest to TV θ 
MSPBE(θ) = Vθ − ΠTVθ 2D, (9) 
where Π is a projection operator which projects arbitrary value functions onto the space of representable functions Hφ. For linear function approximation, the projection Π has the closed form 
ΠV = Vmin θ∈Hφ Vθ − V 2D = Φ(ΦTDΦ)−1ΦTDV , where Φ = [φ(s1),φ(s2),...φ(sm)]T ∈ Rm×n is the feature matrix consisting of rows with features of every state. 
An illustration of the differences between the cost function can be found in Figure 4. The MSBE compares a parameterized value function V θ against TV θ (see the dotted distance in Figure 4), which may lie outside the space of parameterized functions Hφ. The MSPBE first projects TV θ on the set of representable functions and, subsequently, calculates the error (solid distance). 
Example 1 For a simple example of the different distance functions, consider an MDP of two states and one action. The transition probabilities of the MDP and policy are uniform, that is, 
P π = 12 
[1 1 1 
1]. 
The agent receives reward r1 = −0.8 in the first state and r2 = 1.2 in the second state. With a discount factor of γ = 0.8 the true value function is then given by V π = (I − γP π)−1[−0.8 1.2]T = [0 2]T. If we only use a single constant feature φ(s)=1,∀s ∈ S, the feature matrix is Φ = [1 1]T and the parametrization to all states. Hence, the true value function V π V θ = [1 1]Tθ assigns the same value cannot be represented by any parameter, that is, MSE(θ) > 0 ∀θ. In and subsequently TV θ = [−0.8 addition, γP πV 1.2]T +γP πV θ θ is always a vector with equal components has entries different from each other and the MSBE is always greater 0. One can easily verify that the projection is a simple average- 
operator Π = 12 
[1 1 1 1] 
and that θ = 1 satisfies V θ − ΠTVθ = 0, that is, MSPBE(θ)=0. 
The MSPBE circumvents the optimization problems connected to the MSBE, but instead loses the direct connection to the original MSE, the quantity we truly want to minimize. As shown by Sutton et al. (2009), the MSPBE can also be written as 
MSPBE(θ) = Vθ − TVθ 2U = ΦTD(Vθ − TVθ) 2(ΦT DΦ)−1, (10) 
with U = DΦ(ΦTDΦ)−1ΦTD. A derivation of this formulation is given in Appendix A. This formulation reveals two important insights for understanding the MSPBE. First, the 
818 
Policy Evaluation with Temporal Differences 
MSPBE still measures the MSBE, just the metric is now defined as U instead of D. Second, the minimum of the MSPBE is reached if and only if 
ΦTD(Vθ − TVθ) = Ed,P,π[δtφt] = 0. (11) 
This condition means that there is no correlation between the temporal-difference error δt and the feature vector φ(st). Many algorithms, such as TD learning and LSTD have been shown to minimize the MSPBE as their fixpoints satisfy Ed,P,π[δtφt] = 0. 
The insight that the fixpoint of TD learning has the property Ed,P,π[δtφt] = 0 has also motivated the norm of the expected TD update 
NEU(θ) = ΦTD(Vθ − TVθ) 22 = Ed,P,π[δtφt]TEd,P,π[δtφt] (12) 
as an alternative objective function. It shares the same minimum as the MSPBE but has a different shape, and therefore yields different optimization properties such as speed of convergence. 
Many algorithms solve the problem of finding the minimum of the MSPBE indirectly by solving a nested optimization problem (Antos et al., 2008; Farahmand et al., 2008) consisting of the minimization of the operator error (OPE) and the fixed-point error (FPE). The problem is given by 
θ = arg min θ OPE(θ ,ω) = arg min θ V θ − TV ω 2D and (13) ω = arg min ω FPE(θ,ω ) = arg min ω V θ − V ω 2D = arg min ω Φ(θ − ω ) 2D. (14) 
Minimizing the MSPBE is split into two problems where we maintain two estimates of the parameters ω and θ. In the operator problem, we try to approximate the Bellman operator applied to the value function Vω with Vθ. In the fixpoint problem, we reduce the distance between both parameter estimates ω and θ. Many algorithms solve this problem by alternating between improving the operator and fixed-point error. 
To see that the FPE-OPE solution indeed minimizes the MSPBE, we first look at the op- timality conditions of the error functions. By considering the first order optimality criterion of the OPE0 = ∇θ OPE(θ,ω) = ΦTD(Φθ − γΦ ω − R) =ω=θ ΦTD(V θ − TV θ) 
and using optimality in the fixpoint problem (ω = θ), we see that solving the nested OPE- FPE problem (13) – (14) indeed corresponds to minimizing the MSPBE from Equation (11). Note that the optimal value of the operator error is equal to the MSBE value due to ω = θ and OPE(ω,ω) = V ω − TV ω 2D = MSBE(ω). Yet, the problem does not corresponds to minimizing the MSBE as only one of the parameter vectors can change at a time. The OPE- FPE formulation is particularly appealing as it does not suffer from the double-sampling problem. 
2.1.1 Fixpoint Discussion 
Most temporal-difference methods for value estimation converge either to the minimum of MSBE or MSPBE. Thus, the properties of both functions as well as their relation to each

Dann, Neumann and Peters 
other and the mean squared error have been examined thoroughly by Schoknecht (2002) and Scherrer (2010) and in parts by Bach and Moulines (2011), Lazaric et al. (2010), Sutton et al. (2009) and Li (2008). 
In the following, we summarize the most important results for both cost functions. First, MSBE and MSPBE are quadratic functions that are strongly convex if the features are linearly independent, that is, rank(Φ) = m. Linearly independent features are a necessary assumption for the convergence of most temporal-difference methods. Convexity of the cost function guarantees that optimization techniques such as gradient descent do not get stuck in a non-global minimum. Second, the MSBE is larger than the MSPBE for any fixed θ as 
MSBE(θ) = MSPBE(θ) + TVθ − ΠTVθ 2D, 
where TVθ − ΠTVθ an orthogonal projection, 2D is the projection error (dashed distance in Figure 4). As Π is this insight follows directly from the Pythagorean theorem (cf. Figure 4). 
In addition, Williams and Baird (1993) as well as Scherrer (2010) have derived a bound on the MSE by the MSBE 
MSE(θ) ≤ 
√C(d) 
1 − γ MSBE(θ), with C(d) = max si,sj 
∑aP(sj|si,a)π(a|si) 
dπ(si) (15) 
where C(d) is a constant concentration coefficient depending on π and P. The numerator contains the average probability of transitioning from si to sj while the denominator is the probability of the stationary distribution at state si. The term C(d) becomes minimal if the transitions of the MDP are uniform. For the MSPBE no such general bound exists, as the MSPBE only considers part of the MSBE and ignores the projection error. Under mild conditions, the optimal value of MSPBE is always 0, while optima of MSE and MSBE may have larger values (see Example 1). Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996) and Scherrer (2010) provide an example, where the projection error is arbitrarily large, and the MSE value of the MSPBE optimum is therefore unbounded as well. 
MSBE and MSPBE solutions (also referred to as fixpoints, as they satisfy Vθ = TVθ and Vθ = ΠTVθ respectively) have been characterized as different projections of the true value function V Scherrer (2010). onto the space of representable functions These results imply that, if V π ∈ Hφ by Schoknecht (2002) and Hφ, that is, there exist parameters for the true value function, algorithms optimizing MSPBE or MSBE converge to the true solution. If V π cannot be represented, the optima of MSBE and MSPBE are different in general. The natural question, which objective yield better solutions in terms of MSE value, is addressed by Scherrer (2010). The minimum of MSPBE often has a lower mean squared error, however, the solution may get unstable and may yield estimates arbitrarily far away from the true solution V π. Scherrer (2010) illustrated this effect by an example MDP with unstable MSPBE solutions for certain settings of the discount factor γ. On the other hand, the MSBE has been observed to have higher variance in its estimate and is therefore harder to minimize than the MSPBE even if we solve the double-sampling problem (see Section 3.2). While the bound in Equation (15) gives a quality guarantee for the MSBE solution, in practice, it may be too loose for many MDPs as shown in Section 3. In addition, the MSPBE was observed to result in control policies of higher quality, if used as objective

The methods are listed below the sample-based objective function, which they mini- mize at timestep t, denoted by the subscript t. The basic idea of temporal dif- ference learning is to optimize for a different (potentially biased) objective func- tion instead of the MSE directly, since its sample-based approximation MSEt at timestep t converges very slowly to the MSE (due to the large sample variance). The MSPBE, OPE/FPE and NEU objectives (blue shaded) share the same fixed- point and their algorithms converge therefore to the same solution, but possibly at different pace. 
functions in a policy iteration loop (Lagoudakis and Parr, 2003). For these reasons the MSPBE is typically preferred. While MSBE and MSPBE have been studied in detail, the quality of the MSTDE cost function and its exact relation to the MSBE are still open questions. 
Figure 5 provides a visual overview of the important cost functions and their respective algorithms which are introduced in the following section. 
2.2 Algorithm Design 
In the following discussion, we will categorize temporal-difference methods as a combina- tion of cost functions and optimization techniques. While we introduced the former in the previous section, we now focus on the optimization techniques. Temporal-difference meth- ods for value function estimation rely either on gradient-based approaches, least-squares minimization techniques or probabilistic models to minimize the respective cost function. Each optimization approach and the consequent family of temporal-difference methods is presented in Sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. We do not give the complete derivation for every method but instead aim for providing their key ingredients and highlighting similarities and difference between the families. Table 1 lists all algorithms presented in this section along with their most important properties.

Table 1: Overview of Temporal-Difference Methods. The methods can divided into gradient- based approaches, least-squares methods and probabilistic models (from top to bottom, separated by horizontal lines). The prior beliefs in probabilistic models acts as a regularization of the cost function. The fixpoint of the residual-gradient algorithm (RG) and Bellman residual minimization (BRM) depends on whether independent second samples for successor states are used or not. The convergence analysis of FPKF for off-policy estimation is still an open problem (Scherrer and Geist, 2011; Geist and Scherrer, 2013). 
2.2.1 Gradient-Based Approaches 
One family of temporal-difference methods relies on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize their cost function. This optimization technique is directly based on stochastic approximation going back to Robbins and Monro (1951). 
Stochastic gradient descent is typically applied to functions of the form f(θ) = Ep(x)[g(x;θ)], where the expectation is usually approximated by samples and the distri- bution p(x) is independent of θ. The parameter update in gradient descent follows the negative gradient, that is, 
θk+1 = θk − αk∇f(θk) = θk − αkEp(x)[∇g(x;θk)], 
822 
Policy Evaluation with Temporal Differences 
where αk denotes a step-size. While in ordinary gradient descent, also denoted as batch gradient descent, the gradient is calculated using all samples, stochastic gradient descent only evaluates the gradient for one sample  ̃x 
θk+1 = θk − αk∇g( ̃x;θk) with  ̃x ∼ p(x). 
Stochastic updates are guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of f under the mild stochastic approximation conditions (Robbins and Monro, 1951) such that the step-sizes αk ≥ 0 satisfy ∑∞k=0αk = ∞, 
∑∞k=0α2k < ∞. All cost functions in Section 2.1 are expectations with respect to the stationary state distribution dπ. Additionally, observations arrive sequentially in online learning, and there- fore, stochastic gradient descent is particularly appealing as it requires only one sample per update. Stochastic gradient temporal-difference methods update the parameter estimate θt after each observed transition from the current state st to the next state st+1 with action at and reward rt. 
Temporal-Difference Learning. Learning signals similar to temporal differences have been used before, for example by Samuel (1959), but the general concept was first introduced by Sutton (1988) with the temporal-difference (TD) learning algorithm. It is considered to be the first use of temporal differences for value-function estimation. Sometimes, also subsequent approaches are referred to as TD learning algorithms. To avoid ambiguity, we use the term TD learning only for the first algorithm presented by Sutton (1988) and denote all other approaches with temporal-difference methods. The idea tion for the behind TD learning is to minimize true value function V π. Minimizing the MSE where this function V we θ use − TV TVθt θt stochastic gradient descent yields the update rule of TD learning in its basic as approxima-

(16) As the target values TV θt not perform stochastic gradient change descent over on time a well-defined (TV θ0,TV objective θ1,TV θ2,...), function. TD learning does Thus, general stochastic approximation results are not applicable and in fact several issues emerge from the function change. TD learning as in Equation (16) is only guaranteed to converge if the stationary state distribution dπ is used as sampling distribution, that is, on-policy esti- mation. If the value function is estimated from off-policy samples, we can easily construct scenarios where TD learning diverges (Baird, 1995). For a more detailed discussion of the off-policy case we refer to Section 2.4.2. In addition, Tsitsiklis and van Roy (1997) have shown that the TD learning algorithm can diverge for non-linear function approximation. 
TD learning can be understood more clearly as minimization of the nested optimization problem introduced in Equations (13) and (14). More precisely, TD learning first optimizes the fixpoint problem from Equation (14) by setting ω = θt and then performs a stochastic gradient step on the operator problem from Equation (13). Hence, we can already conclude that the convergence point of TD learning is given by 
V θ = ΠT πV θ, 
823 
Dann, Neumann and Peters 
which is the minimum of the MSPBE objective in Equation (9). 
As the results in Section 3 show, the performance of TD learning depends on good step-sizes αt. Hutter and Legg (2007) aim at overcoming the need for optimizing this hyper- parameter. They re-derived TD learning by formulating the least-squares value-function estimate as an incremental update, which yielded automatically adapting learning rates for tabular feature representations. Dabney and Barto (2012) extended this approach to arbi- trary features and additionally proposed another adapting step-size scheme which ensures that the value estimates do not increase the temporal-difference errors δ0,δ1,...,δt ob- served in previous timesteps. Autostep (Mahmood et al., 2012), a learning-rate adaptation approach for incremental learning algorithms based on stochastic gradient, yields individual step-sizes for each feature which may boost learning speed. It relies on a meta-step-size but works well for a wide range of step lengths which makes specifying the meta-parameter easier than the step-size for TD learning directly. 
Residual-Gradient Algorithm. The residual-gradient (RG) algorithm (Baird, 1995) mini- mizes the mean squared Bellman error (MSBE) directly by stochastic gradient descent. Its update rule in the most basic form is given by 
θt+1 =θt + αt[rt + γVθt(st+1) − Vθt(st)](φt − γφt+1) 
=θt + αtδt(φt − γφt+1). 
The difference compared to TD learning is that the gradient of Vθt(st+1) with respect to θt is also incorporated into the update. 
Unfortunately, RG methods suffer from the double-sampling problem mentioned in Sec- tion 2.1. Consider the gradient of the MSBE, in Equation (5), given by 
2Ed[(Vθ(s) − Eπ,P[r(st,at) + γφ(st+1)Tθ|st = s])(φ(s) − γEπ,P[φ(st+1)|st = s])]. (17) 
The outer expectation is computed over the steady state distribution and can be replaced by a single term in stochastic gradient. Both inner expectations are taken over the joint of the policy π and the transition distribution P of the MDP. Multiplying out the brackets yields γ2E[φt+1]E[φt+1]Tθ besides other terms. If we replace both expectations with the current observation φt+1, we obtain a biased estimator since 
φt+1φTt+1 ≈ Stoch. Approx. E[φt+1φTt+1|st] = E[φt+1|st]E[φt+1|st]T + Cov[φt+1,φt+1]. 
Hence, updating the parameters only with the current sample is biased by the covariances Cov[φt+1,φt+1] and Cov[rt,φt+1] with respect to P and π. While this effect can be neglected for deterministic MDPs and policies (since Cov[φt+1,φt+1] = 0,Cov[rt,φt+1] = 0), the residual-gradient algorithm does not converge to a minimizer of the MSBE for stochastic MDPs. It has been shown by Maei (2011) that the residual-gradient algorithm converges to a fixed point of the mean squared TD error2 defined in Equation (8) instead. Alternatively,

each inner expectation in Equation (17) can be replaced by independently drawn samples a t,r t,s t+1 and a t,r t ,s t+1 of the transition 
θt+1 = θt + αt[r t + γVθt(s t+1) − Vθt(st)](φt − γφ t+1). 
With double samples, the residual-gradient algorithm indeed convergences to a fixpoint of the MSBE. However, a second sample is only available, if the model of the MDPs is known or a previously observed transition from the same state is reused. While there have been efforts to avoid the double-sampling problem for other approaches such as the projected fixpoint methods or Bellman residual minimization (Farahmand et al., 2008), it is still an open question whether the bias of the residual-gradient algorithm with single samples can be removed by similar techniques. 
Projected-Fixpoint Methods. The key idea of the projected fixpoint algorithms is to mini- mize the MSPBE directly by stochastic gradient descent (Sutton et al., 2009) and, therefore, overcome the issue of TD learning which alters the objective function between descent steps. Sutton et al. (2009) proposed two different stochastic gradient descent techniques. The derivation starts by writing the MSPBE in a different form given by 
MSPBE(θ) = E[δtφt]TE[φtφTt ]−1E[δtφt]. (18) 
The proof of this equation is provided in Appendix A, Equation (43). We can write the gradient of Equation (18) as 
∇MSPBE(θ) = −2E[(φt − γφt+1)φTt ]E[φtφTt ]−1E[δtφt] (19) = −2E[δtφt]+2γE[φt+1φTt ]E[φtφTt ]−1E[δtφt]. (20) 
The gradient contains a product of expectations of φt+1 and δt in both forms (Equation 19 and 20). As both terms depend on the transition distribution of the MDP, minimizing Equation (18) with stochastic gradient descent again requires two independently drawn samples, as in the residual-gradient algorithm. To circumvent this limitation, a long-term quasi-stationary estimate w of 
E[φtφTt ]−1E[δtφt] = (ΦTDΦ)−1ΦTD(TVθ − Vθ) (21) 
is calculated. To obtain an iterative update for w, we realize that the right side of Equa- tion (21) is the solution to the following least-squares problem 
J(w) = ΦTw − (TV θ − V θ) 22. 
This least-squares problem can also be solved by stochastic gradient descent with the update rule 
wt+1 = wt + βt(δt − φTt wt)φt, 
and the step-size βt. Inserting the estimate wt into Equation (19) and Equation (20) allows us to rewrite the gradient with a single expectation 
∇MSPBE(θ) = −2E[(φt − γφt+1)φt]Twt (22) = −2E[δtφt]+2γE[φt+1φTt ]wt. (23) 
825 
Dann, Neumann and Peters 
Minimizing with the gradient of the form of Equation (22) is called the GTD2 (gradient temporal-difference learning 2) algorithm with update rule 
θt+1 =θt + αt(φt − γφt+1)φTt wt, 
and using the form of Equation (23) yields the TDC (temporal-difference learning with gradient correction) algorithm (Sutton et al., 2009) 
θt+1 =θt + αt(δtφt − γ(φTt wt)φt+1). 
As θ and w are updated at the same time, the choice of step-sizes αt and βt are critical for convergence (see also our experiments in Section. 3). Both methods can be understood as a nested version of stochastic gradient descent optimization. TDC is similar to TD learn- ing, but with an additional term to adjust the TD update to approximate the real gradient of MSPBE. The right side of Figure 7 shows this corrections and compares both stochas- tic approximations to descent following the true gradient. Both algorithms minimize the MSPBE but show different speeds of convergence, as we will also illustrate in the discussion of experimental results in Section 3. 
The predecessor of the GTD2 algorithm is the GTD algorithm (Sutton et al., 2008). It minimizes the NEU cost function from Equation (12) by stochastic gradient descent. The gradient of NEU is given by 
∇NEU(θ) = −2E[(φt − γφt+1)φTt ]E[δtφt]. 
One of the two expectations needs to be estimated by a quasi-stationary estimate in analogy to the other projected fixpoint methods. Hence, the term E[δtφt] is replaced by u which is updated incrementally by 
ut+1 = ut + βt(φTt δt − ut) = (1 − βt)ut + βtφTt δt. 
The updates for θ of GTD are then given by 
θt+1 = θt + αt(φt − γφt+1)φTt ut. 
The update rule for GTD is similar to GTD2 but the quasi stationary estimates w and u are different. While GTD2 searches for the best linear approximation φTt w of E[δt], GTD tries to approximate E[δtφt] with u. As shown by Sutton et al. (2009) and our experiments, GTD2 converges faster and should be preferred over GTD. 
All gradient-based temporal-difference methods only require sums and products of vec- tors of length n to update the parameters. Thus, they run in O(n) time per update. The initial value of θ has a tremendous influence on the convergence speed of gradient-based methods. While other approaches such as LSTD do not require an initial values, the gra- dient based approaches can benefit from good parameter guesses, which are available in numerous applications. For example, the parameter vector learned in previous steps of policy iteration can be used as initial guesses to speed up learning. Fixed-Point Kalman Filtering (FPKF) proposed by Choi and Roy (2006) is a descent method, that has a close re- lationship to TD learning. Yet, as it is motivated by least-squares minimization, we present it in the next section.

Figure 7: Comparison of Gradient Descent and TD learning for the MDP of Figure 6 with γ = 1: The left plot shows the mean squared error. Ideally, we want to find parameters that minimize this objective, however, TD(0) and TDC only find a minimum of the MSPBE (Eq. 9, right plot). The dashed lines show the parameter iterates of batch gradient descent of the respective cost functions. Stochastic gradient methods such as TD and TDC are slower since they can only update θ1 for samples from the beginning of an episode and θ2 for samples from the end (cf. the features from Figure 6). Comparison of both plots shows, that a fixpoint of MSPBE can give arbitrarily bad results for MSE, as the problem is not discounted and the guarantees of Section 2.1 do not hold. The MSPBE and MSBE measures only compare the difference of the value of a state and its successor’s value. Hence, all parameters which yield differences of 2 and arbitrary value of the terminal state are optimal.

2.2.2 Least-Squares Approaches 
Least-squares approaches use all previously observed transitions to determine either the value function directly in one step or an update of the value function. All considered objective functions (cf. Section 2.1) have the form of a standard linear regression problem 
y − Xθ 2U = (y − Xθ)TU(y − Xθ), 
with respect to the (semi-)norm induced by a positive semi-definite matrix U ∈ Rk×k. While the targets are denoted by y ∈ Rk, X ∈ Rk×n is the matrix consisting of rows of basis vectors. Setting the gradient of the objective function with respect to θ to 0 yields the closed-form least-squares solutionθ∗ = (XTUX)−1XTUy. 
Least-Squares Temporal-Difference Learning. The most prominent least-squares method for policy evaluation is least-squares temporal-difference (LSTD) learning (Bradtke and Barto, 1996; Boyan, 2002). LSTD uses the MSPBE as objective function. The least-squares solution of the MSPBE from Equation (10) is given by 
θ = (Φ} TD(Φ {{ − γPΦ)) } 
A 
−1Φ} T{{ DR } 
b 
. (24) 
During the derivation of this solution (see Appendix A) many terms cancel out, including the ones which are connected to the double-sampling problem—in contrast to the analytical solution for minimizing the MSBE shown in Equation (31). Alternatively, LSTD can be derived by considering the analytical solution of the OPE problem from the OPE–FPE formulation (Equations 13 and 14) given by 
θ =(ΦTDΦ)−1ΦTD(R + γPΦω) ω=θ=(ΦTD(Φ − γPΦ))−1ΦTDR. The LSTD solution in the second line is obtained by inserting the solution of the FPE problem, ω = θ, into the first line and re-ordering the terms. 
LSTD explicitly estimates A = ΦTD(Φ − γPΦ) and b = ΦTDR and then determines θ = A−1b robustly (for example with singular value decomposition). The estimates At,bt at time t can be computed iteratively by 
At+1 = At + φt[φt − γφt+1]T, (25) bt+1 = bt + φtrt, (26) 
and converge to A,b (Nedic and Bertsekas, 2003) for t → ∞. For calculating θt we need to invert a n × n matrix. This computational cost can be reduced from O(n3) to O(n2) by updating Yu, 2010). AThe −1 t directly and maintaining direct update of A−1 t can an be estimate derived θt using = A−1 t the bt Sherman-Morrison (Nedic and Bertsekas, formula

with vectors u := φt and v := φt−γφt+1. The resulting recursive LSTD algorithm is listed in Appendix C in a more general form with eligibility traces and off-policy weights (for the basic form set λ = 0 and A−1 An and initial is ideally guess the A−1 0 ρt = 1). has to be chosen by inverse of the null-matrix. hand.

Interestingly, LSTD has a model-based reinforcement learning interpretation. For lookup table representations, the matrix At contains an empirical model of the transition probabil- ities. To see that, we write At and bt as 
At = N − C = N(I − γ P), ˆbt = N R, ˆwhere N is a diagonal matrix containing the state visit counts up to time step t. The elements been observed. Cij of matrix The matrix C contain P ˆthe number of times a transition from state i to state j has = γ−1N−1C denotes the estimated transition probabilities and Rˆi denotes the average observed reward when being in state i. Note that, in this case, the LSTD solution 
θ∗ = 
(N 
(I − γ Pˆ))−1 N R ˆ= 
(I − γ Pˆ)−1 R ˆexactly corresponds to model based policy evaluation with an estimated model. For approx- imate feature spaces, the equivalence to model-based estimation is lost, but the intuition remains the same. A more detailed analysis of this connection can be found in the work of Boyan (2002) and Parr et al. (2008) 
Least-Squares Policy Evaluation. The least-squares policy evaluation (LSPE) algorithm proposed by Nedic and Bertsekas (2003) shares similarities with TD learning and the LSTD method as it combines the idea of least-squares solutions and gradient descent steps. This procedure can again be formalized with the nested OPE-FPE problem from Equations (13) and (14). First, LSPE solves the operator problem 
θt+1 = arg minθ Φθ − TΦωt 2D (28) 
in closed form with the least-squares solution. Then, it decreases the fixpoint error by performing a step in the direction of the new θt+1 
ωt+1 = ωt + αt(θt+1 − ωt), (29) 
where αt ∈ (0,1] is a predefined step size. The vector ωt is the output of the algorithm at time-step t, that is, the parameter estimate for the value function. In practice, the step-sizes are large in comparison to stochastic gradient approaches and can often be set to 1. 
The solution of the LSPE problem from Equation (28) is given by 
θt+1 = (Φ} TDΦ){{ −1 } M 
ΦTD(R + γΦ ωt), (30) 
829 
Dann, Neumann and Peters 
where Φ is the matrix containing the features of the successor states, that is, Φ = P πΦ. The current estimate Mt of (ΦTDΦ)−1 can again be updated recursively with the Sherman- Morrison formula from Equation (27) similar to before, which yields the update rule of LSPE summarized in Algorithm 7 in Appendix C. As LSPE solves the nested OPE-FPE problem, it also converges to the MSPBE fixpoint (Nedic and Bertsekas, 2003). Hence, LSPE and LSTD find the same solution, but LSPE calculates the value function recursively using least-squares solutions of the OPE problem while LSTD acquires the value function directly by solving both, OPE and FPE, problems in closed form. LSPE allows adapting the step-sizes αt of the updates and using prior knowledge for the initial estimate of ω0, which serves as a form of regularization. Therefore, LSPE does not aim for the minimum of the MSPBE approximated by samples up to the current timestep, it instead refines the previous estimates. Such behavior may avoid numerical issues of LSTD and is less prone to over-fitting. 
Fixed-Point Kalman Filtering. Kalman filtering is a well known second-order alternative to stochastic gradient descent. Choi and Roy (2006) applied the Kalman filter to temporal- difference learning, which resulted in the Fixed-Point Kalman Filtering (FPKF) algorithm. As in TD learning, FPKF solves the nested optimization problem from Equations (13) and (14) and hence finds the minimum of the MSPBE objective function. However, instead of stochastic gradient descent, FPKF performs a second order update by multiplying the standard TD learning update with the inverse of the Hessian Ht of the operator error given in Equation (13). FPKF can therefore be also understood as an approximate Newton-method on the OPE problem. The Hessian Ht is given by the second derivative of the OPE 
Ht = 1t 
∑ti=1 
φiφTi . 
φiφTi . 
Note that the Hessian is calculated from the whole data set i = 1,...,t up to the current time step and does not depend on the parameters θ. The update rule of FPKF is thus given by 
θt+1 = θt + αtH−1 t φtδt. 
This update rule can also be derived directly from the Kalman filter updates if αt is set to 1/t. See Figure 8 for a graphical model illustrating the Kalman Filter assumptions (e.g., the definition of the evolution and observation function). For small values of t, the matrix Ht becomes singular. In this case Ht needs to be regularized or the pseudo-inverse of Ht has to be used. As FPKF is a second order method, it typically converges with fewer iterations than TD but comes with additional of of LSPE, FPKF Hshown −1 t can updated directly in Algorithm 9 price in of estimating O(n2) H−1 t . Analogously to the derivation which yields the recursive parameter updates (adapted from the work of Scherrer and Geist, 2011 and Geist and Scherrer, 2013). The step-size αt problem, where all targets = 1/t of Kalman filtering basically assumes a stationary regression ri + γφTi+1θi are equally important. However, it is beneficial to give later targets more weight, as the parameter estimates are getting more accurate and therefore the targets ri + γφTi+1θi are becoming more reliable.

Figure 8: Illustration of the model assumptions of Fixed-Point Kalman Filtering. FPKF aims at estimating the value of the hidden variable θ assuming a noise-free transi- tion function (stationary environment, variable is constant over time). The main idea of FPKF is to use estimates of previous timesteps to compute the outputs ri + γφTi θi and treat them as fixed and observed in later timesteps. This as- sumption makes FPKF essentially different from KTD (cf. Figure 9), which only considers ri as observed. 
recent time-steps can be achieved by using a step-size αt which decreases slower than 1/t, for example, a/(a + t) for some large a. 
Bellman Residual Minimization. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) was one of the first approaches for approximate policy evaluation proposed by Schweitzer and Seidmann (1985). It calculates the least-squares solution of the MSBE given by 
θ = (∆Φ} T{{ D∆Φ) } 
F 
−1∆Φ} {{ TDR } 
g 
, (31) 
where ∆Φ = Φ − γP πΦ denotes the difference of the state features and the expected next state features discounted by γ. Again, the matrices F and g can be estimated by samples, similar to A and b of LSTD, that is, 
F t = 
∑tk=0(φk − γφ k+1)(φk − γφ k+1)T, gt = 
∑t(φk − γφ k+1)r k. k=0However, as the residual-gradient algorithm, BRM suffers from the double-sampling problem because F t contains the product φk+1φTk+1 of the features of the next state and gt the product φk+1rk (see Section 2.1 and the discussion of the residual-gradient algorithm in Section 2.2.1). It therefore minimizes the MSTDE if we use one successor state sample, that independent is, set φ samples k+1 employed for either = a φ s finite k+1k+1. , r state To k converge to and space s k+1 where r k. a minimum of the MSBE, we have to use two For this reason, the BRM algorithm can only be we can visit each state multiple times or if we know the model of the MDP. See Algorithm 10 in Appendix C for the recursive update rules with double samples. For updates with a single sample see Algorithm 11, which already includes eligibility traces (from Scherrer and Geist, 2011; Geist and Scherrer, 2013, see also Section 2.4.1). If we compare the least-squares solutions for the MSPBE and the MSBE, we

Figure 9: Graphical Model of Kalman TD learning and Gaussian-process TD learning for linearly parameterized value functions. Both approaches assume that a Gaussian process θTt generates the random variables and linear function approximation vt = φt is used. KTD aims to track the hidden state (blue dashed set of variables) at each time step given the reward observation generated by the relationship (bend arrows, in red) of the Bellman equation. While GPTD assumed θ to be constant over time, that is, θt+1 = θt, KTD allows changing parameters. 
can see that the product of ∆ΦT∆Φ cancels out for the MSPBE due to the projection of the MSBE in the feature space and the MSPBE can subsequently avoid the double-sampling problem. 
2.2.3 Probabilistic Models 
While gradient-based and least-squares approaches are motivated directly from an optimiza- tion point of view, probabilistic methods take a different route. They build a probabilistic model and infer value function parameters which are most likely, given the observations. These methods not only yield parameter estimates that optimize a cost function, but also provide a measure of uncertainty of these estimates. Especially in policy iteration, this information can be very helpful to decide whether more observations are necessary or the value function estimate is sufficiently reliable to improve the policy. 
Gaussian-process temporal-difference learning (GPTD) by Engel et al. (2003, 2005) as- sumes that the rewards rt as well as the unknown true values of the observed states vt = V (st) are random variables generated by a Gaussian process. The Bellman Equa- tion (2) specifies the relation between the variables 
 ̃vt := vt + ∆vt = rt + γ(vt+1 + ∆vt+1), (32) where  ̃vt particular θ1θ2∆v1 ∆v2

Please see Figure 9 for a graphical model illustrating the dependencies of the random variables. While ∆vt ∼ N(0,σ2) always has mean zero, we have to set its variances σt a-priori based on our belief of π and P. The covariance Σt of all 
832 
Policy Evaluation with Temporal Differences 
∆vi for i = 1,...,t is a band matrix with bandwidth 2 as the noise terms of two subsequent time steps are correlated. 
We consider again a linear approximation of the value function, that is, vt = φTt θ. Prior knowledge about the parameter θ can be incorporated in the prior p(θ), which acts as a regularizer and is usually set to N(0,I). GPTD infers the mean and covariance of the Gaussian distribution of θ given the observations r0,...,rt and our beliefs. The mean value corresponds to the maximum a-posteriori prediction and is equivalent to finding the solution of the regularized linear regression problem 
θt = arg minθ ∆Φtθ − rt 2Σ−1 t + θ 2, (33) 
where rt = [r0,r1,...,rt]T is a vector containing all observed rewards. The matrix ∆Φt = [∆φ0,...,∆φt]T is the difference of features of all transitions with ∆φt = φt − γφt+1. The solution of this problem can be formulated as 
θt = (∆ΦtΣ−1 t ∆ΦTt + I)−1 ∆ΦtΣ−1 t rt. (34) 
At first glance, the solution is similar to the MSBE least-squares solution. However, the noise terms are often highly correlated and, hence, Σ−1 t is not a diagonal matrix. We can transform the regression problem in Equation (33) into a standard regularized least-squares problem with i.i.d. sampled data points by a whitening transformation (for details see Appendix B). We then see that the whitening transforms the reward vector rt into the vector of the long term returns Rt where the hth elements corresponds to (Rt)h = ∑tk=h γk−hrk. Consequently, the mean prediction of GPTD is equivalent to regularized Monte-Carlo value- function estimation (cf. Section 1.2) and minimizes the MSE from Equation (4) in the limit of infinite observations. For finite amount of data, the prior on θ compensates the high variance problem of Monte-Carlo estimation, but may also slow down the learning process. The quantity in Equation (34) can be computed incrementally without storing ∆Φt explicitly or inverting a n × n-matrix at every timestep by a recursive algorithm shown in Algorithm 12. Its full derivation can be found in Appendix 2.1 of Engel (2005). The most expensive step involves a matrix product of the covariance matrix P t ∈ Rn×n of θt and ∆φt+1. Thus, GPTD has a runtime complexity of O(n2). 
Kalman temporal-difference learning (KTD) by Geist and Pietquin (2010) is another probabilistic model very similar to GPTD. While it is based on the same assumptions of Gaussian distributed random variables, it approaches the value estimation problem from a filtering or signal processing perspective. KTD uses a Kalman Filter to track a hidden state, which changes over time and generates the observed rewards at every timestep. The state consists of the parameter to estimate θt and the value difference variables ∆vt,∆vt−1 with ∆vt =  ̃vt − φtθt of the current and last timestep. As in GPTD, the rewards are generated from this state with Equation (32) resulting in the linear observation function g 
rt = g(θt,∆vt,∆vt+1)=[φt − γφt+1]θt + ∆vt − γ∆vt+1. 
KTD does not necessarily assume that a unique single parameter θ has created all rewards, but allows the parameter to change over time (as if the environment is non-stationary). More precisely, θt+1 ∼ N(θt,Σθ) is modeled as a random walk. As we focus on stationary environments, we can set Σθ = 0 to enforce constant parameters and faster convergence. 
833 
Dann, Neumann and Peters 
In this case, KTD and GPTD are identical algorithms for linear value function parametriza- tion (cf. Algorithm 12). The graphical model in Figure 9 illustrates the similar assumptions of both approaches. Besides KTD’s ability to deal with non-stationary environments, KTD and GPTD differ mostly in the way they handle value functions that are non-linear in the feature space. KTD relies on the unscented transform (a deterministic sample approximation for nonlinear observation functions), while GPTD avoids explicit function parametrization assumptions with kernels (cf. Section 2.3). Depending on the specific application and avail- able domain knowledge, either a well-working kernel or a specific nonlinear parametrization is easier to chose. 
Both probabilistic approaches share the benefit of not only providing a parameter esti- mate but also an uncertainty measure on it. However, as they optimize the mean squared error similar to Monte Carlo value-function estimation, their estimates may suffer from higher variance. The long-term memory effect originating from the consideration of all future rewards also prevents off-policy learning as discussed by Geist and Pietquin (2010, Section 4.3.2) and Engel (2005). 
2.3 Feature Handling 
The feature representation φ of the states has a tremendous influence, not only on the qual- ity of the final value estimate but also on convergence speed. We aim for features that can represent the true value function accurately and are as concise as possible to reduce compu- tational costs and the effects of over-fitting. Many commonly used feature functions are only locally active. Their components are basis functions which have high values in a specific region of the state space and low ones elsewhere. For example, cerebellar model articulation controllers (CMAC) cover the state space with multiple overlapping tilings (Albus, 1975), also known as tile-coding. The feature function consists of binary indicator functions for each tile. Alternatively, smoother value functions can be obtained with radial basis functions. Such bases work well in practice, but often only if they are normalized such that φ(s) 1 = 1 for all states s ∈ S as discussed by Kretchmar and Anderson (1997). The performance of many algorithms, including the regularization methods discussed in Section 2.3.2, can be improved by using normalized features with zero mean and unit variance. 
Local function approximators are limited to small-scale settings as they suffer from the curse of dimensionality similar to exact state representations (cf. Section 1.2). When the number of state dimensions increases, the number of features explodes exponentially and so does the amount of data required to learn the value function. Therefore, recent work has focused on facilitating the search for well-working feature functions. These efforts follow two principled approaches: (1) features are either generated automatically from the observed data or (2) the learning algorithms are adapted to cope with huge numbers of features efficiently in terms of data and computation time. We briefly review the advances in both directions in the following two sections. 
2.3.1 Automatic Feature Generation 
Kernel-based value function estimators represent the value of a state in terms of the similarity of that state to previously observed ones, that is, at each time step the similarity to current state is added as an additional feature. A well chosen kernel, that is, the distance or similarity

measure, is crucial for the performance of kernel-based approaches, as well as an adequate sparsification technique to prevent the number of features to grow unboundedly. 
GPTD (Engel et al., 2003) and LSTD (Xu et al., 2005, known as Kernelized LSTD, KLSTD) have been extended to use kernelized value functions. A similar approach was proposed in the work of Rasmussen and Kuss (2003) where a kernel-based Gaussian process is used for approximating value functions based on the Bellman Equation (2). This approach, KLSTD and GPTD were unified in a model-based framework for kernelized value function approximation by Taylor and Parr (2009). Jung and Polani (2006) introduced an alternative online algorithm originating from least-squares support-vector machines to obtain the GPTD value function estimate; however, it is limited to MDPs with deterministic transitions. 
An alternative to kernel methods based on spectral learning was presented by Mahade- van and Maggioni (2007). The authors proposed to build a graph-representation of the MDP from the observations and chose features based on the eigenvector of the Graph-Laplacian. Compared to location-based features such as radial basis functions, this graph-based tech- nique can handle discontinuities in the value-function more accurately. In contrast, Menache et al. (2005) assumes a fixed class of features, for example, RBFs, and optimizes only the free parameters (e.g., the basis function widths) by gradient descent or by using the cross- entropy optimization method (De Boer et al., 2010). Keller et al. (2006) uses neighborhood component analysis, a dimensionality reduction techniques for labeled data, to project the high-dimensional state space to a lower dimensional feature representation. They take the observed Bellman errors from Equation (7) as labels to obtain features that are most ex- pressive for the value function. The approaches of Parr et al. (2007), Painter-Wakefield and Parr (2012a) and Geramifard et al. (2013, 2011) are based on the orthogonal matching principle (Pati et al., 1993) and incrementally add features which have high correlation with the temporal-difference error. The intuition is that those additional features enable the algorithms to further reduce the temporal-difference error. 
2.3.2 Feature Selection by Regularization 
Value function estimators face several challenges when the feature space is high dimensional. First, the computational costs may become unacceptably large. Second, a large number of noise-like features deteriorates the estimation quality due to numerical instabilities and, finally, the amount of samples required for a reliable estimate grows prohibitively. The issues are particularly severe for least-squares approaches which are computationally more involved and tend to over-fit when the number of observed transitions is lower than the dimensionality of the features. 
The problem of computational costs for second order methods can be addressed by calculating the second order updates incrementally. For example, the parameter update of incremental LSTD (iLSTD proposed by Geramifard et al., 2006a,b) is linear in the total number of features (O(n) instead of O(n2) for standard LSTD) if only a very small number of features is non-zero in each state. Most location based features such as CMAC or fixed- horizon radial basis functions fulfill this condition. 
Information theoretic approaches which compress extensive feature representations are prominent tools in machine learning for reducing the dimensionality of a problem. Yet, these methods are often computationally very demanding which limits their use in online

reinforcement learning. Some information theoretic approaches are equivalent to a special form of regularization. Regularization is a standard way to avoid over-fitting by adding punishment terms for large parameters θ. The regularization point of view often leads to computationally cheaper algorithms compared to information theory. Hence, there has been increasing interest in adding different regularization terms to LSTD and similar algorithms (cf. Table 2). As in supervised learning, the most common types of regularization terms are l1 and l2-regularization, which penalize large l1 respective l2 norms of the parameter vector. While l2-regularization still allows closed form solutions, it becomes problematic when there are only very few informative features and a high number of noise-like features. Regularizing with l2-terms usually yields solutions with small but non-zero parameters in each dimension, which have low quality when there are many noise-like features. l1-regularization on the other hand prevents closed form solutions, but is known to induce sparsity for the resulting estimate of θ where only few entries are different from zero. Hence, l1-regularization implic-

itly performs a feature selection and can cope well with many irrelevant features. Therefore, it is well suited for cases where the number of features exceeds the number of samples. 
Most regularization methods are derived from the nested OPE-FPE optimization formu- lation of LSTD in Equations (13)–(14) where the regularization term is added either to the FPE problem, to the OPE problem or in both problems3 
ˆθ = arg minθ V θ − TV ˆω 2D + 1t f(θ) and ˆω = arg minω Φ(ˆθ − ω) 2D + 1t g(ω). 
Using the regularization term f(θ) corresponds to regularization before setting the fixpoint solution in the OPE problem while enabling g(ω) regularizes after employing the fixpoint solution. Using an l2-penalty in f(θ), that is, f(θ) = βf θ 22 yields the solution ˆθ = (A + βft−1I)−1b. This form of regularization is often considered as the standard regularization approach for LSTD, since it is equivalent to initializing M0 = A−1 0 = β−1 f I in the recursive LSTD algorithm (Algorithm 5). The posterior mean of GPTD also corresponds to LSTD with an l2-regularization of the operator problem if both algorithms are extended with eligibility traces (see the next section). In addition to the regularization of the operator problem, Farahmand et al. (2008) and Hoffman et al. (2011) proposed an l2-penalty for the fixpoint problem (i.e., g(ω) = βg ω 22). There are still closed-form solutions for both problems with l2-regularizations. However, the benefits of such regularization in comparison to just using f(θ) still need to be explored. 
Regularization with l1-norm was first used by Kolter and Ng (2009) in the operator problem, that is, f(θ) = βf θ 1 and g(ω)=0. They showed that l1-regularization gives consistently better results than l2 in a policy iteration framework and is computationally faster for a large number of irrelevant features. Yet, using l1-regularization for the OPE problem prevents a closed form solution and the resulting optimization problem called Lasso- TD is non-convex. The least-angle regression algorithm (Efron et al., 2004) could be adapted to solve this optimization problem which yielded the LARS-TD algorithm (Kolter and Ng, 2009). Johns et al. (2010) started from the Lasso-TD problem but reformulated it as a linear complementarity problem (Cottle et al., 1992), for which standard solvers can be employed. Additionally, this linear complementary TD (LC-TD) formulation allows using warm-starts when the policy changes.4 Ghavamzadeh et al. (2011) showed that the Lasso-TD problem has a unique fixpoint which means that LC-TD and LARS-TD converge to the same solution. In addition, Ghavamzadeh et al. (2011) provided bounds on the MSE for this fixpoint. 
The l1-Projected-Bellman-Residual (l1-PBR) method (Geist and Scherrer, 2011) puts the regularization onto the fixpoint problem instead of the operator problem, that is, f(θ) = 0 and g(ω) = βg ω 21. Hoffman et al. (2011) proposed a similar technique but with addi- tional l2-penalty on the operator problem. Regularizing FPE problem with an l1 norm allows for a closed form solution of the OPE problem. Using this solution in the regularized FPE problem reduces to a standard Lasso problem and, hence, a standard Lasso solver

can be employed instead of specialized solution as for the Lasso-TD problem. Furthermore, Lasso-TD has additional requirements on the A-matrix of LSTD5 which generally only hold in on-policy learning. Approaches with l1-regularized operator problems do not have this limitation and only make mild assumptions in off-policy settings. Despite these theoretical benefits, empirical results indicate comparable performance to the Lasso-TD formulation and, hence, l1-regularization for the FPE problem is a promising alternative. 
Petrik et al. (2010) propose using l1-regularization in the linear program formulation of dynamic programming for finding the value function. However, their analysis concentrates on the case where the transition kernel Pπ is known or approximated by multiple samples. Another family of methods considers the linear system formulation of LSTD Aθ = b directly. Pires (2011) suggests to solve this system approximately with additional l1-regularization 
ˆθ = arg minθ Aθ − b 22 + βt θ 1. 
Again, this problem is a standard convex Lasso problem solvable by standard algorithms and applicable to off-policy learning. Dantzig-LSTD (D-LSTD, Geist et al., 2012) takes a similar approach and considers 
ˆθ = arg minθ θ 1 subject to Aθ − b ∞ ≤ βt . 
This optimization problem, a standard linear program, is motivated by the Dantzig selector of Candes and Tao (2005) and can be solved efficiently. It is also well-defined for off-policy learning. The aim of this problem is to minimize the sum of all parameters while making sure that the linear system of LSTD is not violated by more than βt−1 in each dimension. 
All regularization approaches so far have treated each parameter dimension equally. However, it might be helpful to give the parameter components different weights. Johns and Mahadevan (2009) suggested to use the Laplacian L of the graph-based representation of the MDP as weights and add βL LΦθ 2D as an additional term to the MSPBE. Investigating the benefits of other problem-dependent weighted norms are left for future work. The performance of all regularization schemes strongly depends on the regularization strength β, which has to be specified by hand, found by cross-validation or set with the method of Farahmand and Szepesvári (2011). 
Instead of regularizing the value-function estimation problem, we could also estimate the value function directly with LSTD in a lower-dimensional feature space. Ghavamzadeh et al. (2010) showed in a theoretical analysis that projecting the original high-dimensional features to a low-dimensional space with a random linear transformation (LSTD with Ran- dom Projections, LSTD-RP) has the same effect as regularization. However, no empirical results for this algorithm are given. Alternatively, features can be selected explicitly to form the lower-dimensional space. Hachiya and Sugiyama (2010) proposed to consider the conditional mutual information between the rewards and the features of observed states and provided an efficient approximation scheme to select a good subset as features. 
There have also been efforts to regularize Bellman residual minimization. Loth et al. (2007) added an l1-penalty to the MSBE and proposed a gradient-based technique to find

matrices with all of their principal minors positive.

Policy Evaluation with Temporal Differences 
the minimum incrementally. In contrast, Farahmand et al. (2008) regularized with an l2- term to obtain the optimum in closed form. Gradient-based TD-algorithms are less prone to over-fitting than least-squares approaches when few transitions are observed as the norm of the parameter vector is always limited for a small number of updates. However, if the observed transitions are re-used by running several sweeps of stochastic gradient updates, regularization becomes as relevant as for the least-squares approaches. In addition, if a large number of features are irrelevant for the state value, the gradient and especially its stochastic approximation becomes less reliable. Therefore, there has been recent interest in promoting sparseness by adding a soft-threshold shrinkage operator to gradient-based algorithms (Painter-Wakefield and Parr, 2012b; Meyer et al., 2012) and reformulating the regularized objective as a convex-concave saddle-point problem (Liu et al., 2012). 
Despite the extensive work on regularization schemes for LSTD, many directions still need to be explored. For example, many feature spaces in practice have an inherent struc- ture. They may for instance consist of multiple coverings of the input space with radial basis functions of different widths. There has been work on exploiting such structures with hier- archical regularization schemes in regression and classification problems (Zhao et al., 2009; Jenatton et al., 2010). These approaches divide the parameters into groups and order the groups in a hierarchical structure (e.g., trees), which determines the regularization in each group. While such schemes have been successfully applied to images and text documents, it is an open question whether they can be adapted to work online and to which extent policy evaluation tasks could benefit from hierarchical regularization. 
2.4 Important Extensions 
In the previous sections, temporal-difference methods have been introduced in their most basic form to reveal the underlying ideas and avoid cluttered notation. We now introduce two extensions which are applicable to most methods. First, we briefly discuss eligibility traces for improving the learning speed by considering the temporal difference of more than one timestep. Subsequently, importance-reweighting is presented which enables temporal- difference methods to estimate the value function from off-policy samples. While the aim of this paper is giving a survey of existing methods, we will also present an alternative implementation of importance reweighting for LSTD and TDC which considerably decreases the variance of their estimates. We focus on the purpose and the functionality of eligibility traces and importance reweighting and, hence, illustrate their actual implementation only for selected TD methods. 
2.4.1 Eligibility Traces 
Eligibility traces (e-traces, Sutton, 1988) are an efficient implementation of blending between TD methods and Monte-Carlo sampling. To understand the purpose of this blending, it is beneficial to first identify the different sources of errors in TD methods. While we derived the update rules of the algorithms based on observed samples directly from the underlying cost functions such as MSE, MSBE or MSPBE, we now make the sample-based approximations of the objective functions explicit. These approximations at a given timestep t are denoted by a subscript t, for example, MSEt, MSBEt or MSPBEt (see also Figure 5).

Objective Bias, e.g. arg min MSE(θ) = arg min MSPBE(θ) 
Figure 10: Visualization of Conceptual Error Sources for Policy Evaluation Methods: The sampling error is always present and accounts for the approximation of the cho- sen objective function with observed samples. The higher the variance of these samples the higher the sampling error. If the objective of the method is not di- rectly the MSE, the method will suffer from the objective bias. The optimization error is present for methods which do not find the minimum of the approximated objective function directly, for example, gradient-based approaches. The posi- tions of the boxes and their overlap with the shaded areas denote the extent, to which the respective methods suffer from each error source. Note that the actual amount of each error source is not visualized and varies drastically between differ- ent MDPs, feature representations, policies and number of time steps. MSPBEt denotes the approximation of the MSPBE with samples observed at timesteps 1 to t. 
Error Decomposition. Leaving numerical issues aside, there are three conceptual sources of errors as illustrated in Figure 10. Consider for example Monte-Carlo sampling, which does not rely on temporal differences, but simply takes the observed accumulated reward as a sample for each state. Hence, at time t, it finds the parameter estimate by computing the minimum of 
MSEt(θ) = 
Sampling Error, e.g. arg min MSPBEt(θ) = arg min MSPBE(θ)

MSE(θ) = 
∑tk=i

∑k=0∞γkP kR∥∥∥∥∥2. (35) D840 
Policy Evaluation with Temporal Differences 
The difference between the approximation and the true objective function, referred to as sampling error, is present for all methods. TD methods avoid estimating γkP kR for k > 0 directly by replacing these terms with the value function estimate, that is, use bootstrapping with the Bellman operator T. As the replaced terms cause the high variance, the sampling error decreases at the price of a possible increase in the objective bias. This bias denotes the difference between the minimum of the TD objective function (such as MSPBE or MSBE) and the true minimum of the MSE. The regularization with priors in GPTD and KTD is an alternative for reducing the variance at the price of a temporary objective bias. Descent approaches such as the gradient methods, LSPE or FPKF do not compute the minimum of the current objective approximation analytically, but only make a step in its direction. Hence, they suffer from an additional optimization error. Although the errors caused by each source do not add up, but may counterbalance each other, it is a reasonable goal to try to minimize the effect of each source. 
The magnitude of each type of error depends on the actual MDP, feature representation, policy and number of observed transitions. For example, the objective bias of MSPBE or MSBE vanishes for features that allow representing the true value function exactly. On the other hand, a setup where the MDP and policy are deterministic has zero variance for γkP kR and hence, introducing a bias with bootstrapping does not pay off. By interpolating between TD methods and Monte-Carlo estimates, we can often find an algorithm where the effects of sampling error and objective bias is minimized. The natural way to do so is to replace γkP kR only for terms k > h in Equation (35), which yields the h-step Bellman operator 
T hV = TT } {{ ...T } 
h times 
V = γhP hV + 
h−1∑γkP kR. k=0As it considers the h future rewards, it is also referred to as h-step look-ahead (Sutton and Barto, 1998). If we used the h-step Bellman operator to redefine the objective functions (e.g., MSBE or MSPBE), we would need to observe the rewards rt,rt+1,...rt+h−1 and state st+h before we could use st for estimation, that is, approximating T hV (st) with a sample corresponds to 
T hV (st) ≈ γhV (st+h) + 
h−1∑k=0γkrt+k. 
Hence, online estimation is not possible for large h. Eligibility traces circumvent this problem and allow taking each sample into account immediately. 
Eligibility Traces. average over all T k 
Eligibility traces rely on the λ-Bellman operator Tλ defined as a weighted

∑∞k=0λkT k+1. (36)

operator such as the MSPBEλ objective 
MSPBEλ(θ) = Vθ − ΠTλVθ 2D. 
For λ = 0 only T 1 = T is used and, hence, MSPBE0 corresponds to the standard MSPBE. Only considering T∞ in the objective corresponds to the MSE from Equation (35). Due to the discount factor γ, there exists a K such that T kV deviates less than a small constant from T ∞V for all k>K. For λ = 1, the terms k>K in Equation (36) are given infinitely more weight than k ≤ K MSPBE1 is equivalent to the MSE. 
and hence limλ→1 Tλ = T ∞. We realize that the 
The basic idea of eligibility traces is to approximate the k-step Bellman operators in the weighted sum with samples as soon as possible. Thus, at timestep t, state st is used for T 1, state st−1 for T 2, st−2 for T 3 and so on. The special choice of exponentially decreasing weights allows storing the previously observed states efficiently as a summed vector, a so- called eligibility trace. 
Implementation for TD Learning. To illustrate the efficient approximation of Tλ and eligi- bility traces as compact storage of previously observed features, we consider the extension of the standard TD learning algorithm for multi-step temporal differences. Its extended update rule is given by 
θt+1 = θt + αtδt 
∑tk=0(λγ)kφt−k. (37) The parameter λ puts more weight on more recent states. As shown by Sutton and Barto (1998), the multi-step look-ahead (forward view), that is, considering future rewards in the Bellman operator, can also be understood as propagating the temporal-difference error backwards in time (often called the backward view), that is, updating the value of states observed the the sum past ∑activations before. tk=0(λγ)The kφof t−k update the incrementally. features in Equation and (37) can be implemented efficiently by computing 
More precisely, the eligibility trace vector zt is updated by

zt+1 = φt + λγzt. Updating the eligibility trace in such a way ensures that timesteps. The update rule of TD learning can then be written zt+1 more = concisely ∑tk=0(λγ)with kφt−k eligibility for all 
traces as 
θt+1 = θt + αtδtzt+1. The TD learning algorithm with a certain setting of λ is often referred to as TD(λ) where TD(0) corresponds to the standard TD learning algorithm without eligibility traces. 
For λ > 0, the algorithm also updates the value function at states sh with h<t, which is reasonable, as the value at state st−1 is very likely to change when V (st) changes. In contrast, TD(0) learning does not reuse its data-points and would need to observe state st−1 again to update the value function at state st−1. Subsequently, st−2 needs to be visited again to update V (st−2), and so on. Hence, eligibility traces not only allow one to find the best trade-off between objective bias and sampling error, but also reduce the optimization error for gradient based approaches.

Eligibility Traces for Other Algorithms. Most algorithms presented in this paper have been extended to use eligibility traces (see Table 1 for an overview). LSTD (Boyan, 2002), TDC (originally named GTD(λ) in Maei, 2011, but here referred to as TDC(λ) for clarity), FPKF (Scherrer and Geist, 2011; Geist and Scherrer, 2013) and BRM (Scherrer and Geist, 2011; Geist and Scherrer, 2013) have been extended to use multistep-lookahead with eligibility traces. LSPE(λ) (Nedic and Bertsekas, 2003) has been formulated with traces from the beginning. Eligibility traces have also been introduced in GPTD by Engel (2005).6 Recently, eligibility-traces-versions of GTD2 and the residual-gradient algorithm named GTD2(λ) and gBRM(λ) (Geist and Scherrer, 2013) have been developed. All the algorithms above converge to a minimum of the MSPBEλ objective or respectively MSBEλ, which is defined analogously. 
Example 2 We illustrate the benefit of interpolating between MSPBE and MSE in two experiments using e-traces and LSTD. Consider a discrete 40 state / 40 action MDP where actions of the agent deterministically determine its next state. In the first experiment, we use a perfect feature representation, that is, the value function can be estimated perfectly,

while, in the second experiment, we use an incomplete feature representation by projecting the states linearly on a random 20-dimensional feature space. In both experiments, we evaluated the performance of different λ values for different policies. We varied the stochasticity of the policy, by interpolating between a greedy policy, which visits one state after another, and the uniform policy, which transitions to each state with equal probability. 
In Figure 11a, we can see the results for the perfect feature representation. Here, the MSPBEλ does not cause any bias and its minimum coincides with the MSE solution. The plots show the relative MSE values for different λ settings for different levels of stochasticity in the system controlled by the linear blending coefficient between the greedy and uniform pol- icy. The results confirm our intuition that using λ = 0 is always optimal for perfect features as the MSPBE minimization is unbiased. As the policy is the only source of stochasticity in the system, it behaves deterministically for the greedy policy and the performance is invariant to the choice of λ. 
The picture changes for the imperfect feature representation where the minimization of the MSPBEλ causes a bias for the MSE (cf. Figure 11b). Setting λ = 1 performs best for the greedy policy as there is again no variance on the returns, and, hence, we avoid the bias of the MSPBEλ by directly minimizing the MSE. When gradually increasing the stochasticity of the policy, the optimal value of λ decreases and finally reaches the value of 0. This example illustrates that eligibility traces cause significant speed-ups of learning speed for LSTD(λ) and that the best trade-off between objective bias and sampling error highly depends on the intrinsic stochasticity of the MDP and policy. Hence, λ should be considered as an additional hyper-parameter to optimize for each setting. 
2.4.2 Generalization to Off-Policy Learning by Importance Reweighting 
In previous sections, we aimed at estimating state values V π while observing the agent following policy π. However, in many applications we want to know V π, but only have observed samples with actions chosen by a different policy. Estimating the state values of a different policy than the observed one is referred to as off-policy value-function estimation (cf. Section 1.2). For instance, we could be following an exploration policy while we want to know the value function of the optimal greedy policy. In a policy iteration scenario, we can employ off-policy policy evaluation to re-use data points collected with previous policies. Hence, off-policy value-function estimation is an important ingredient for efficiently learning control policies. A different application of off-policy estimation is intra-option learning (Sutton et al., 1998), where we can use samples from different options to update the value functions of the single options. 
Importance Reweighting. Leveraging temporal-difference methods for off-policy estimation is based on the idea of importance sampling (cf. Glynn and Iglehart, 1989). Importance sampling is a well-known variance-reduction technique in statistics. It is used to approximate the expectation Ep[f(X)] of a function f with input X ∼ p, when we cannot directly sample from p(X) but have access to samples from another distribution q(X). In this case, the expectation Ep[f(X)] can be approximated by 
Ep[f(X)] = Eq[p(X)

In the orthogonal case x2, the weights are larger than one and give under-represented samples more weight. 
where x1,...xM are realizations of q. The correctness of this statement in the limit M → ∞ can be easily verified by writing out the expectations. Each sample drawn from q is re- weighted with importance weights ρi = p(xi)/q(xi) to approximate Ep[f(X)]. See Figure 12 for a visualization. The reweighting is only well-defined, if q(X) = 0 for all X with non-zero p(X). 
Limitations of Off-Policy Estimation. Similar to on-policy estimation, the following ob- servation model for off-policy transitions is assumed: the departing state st is distributed according to the state distribution d while the action at is sampled from the behavior policy πB and the entering state st+1 from the MDP dynamics P. For on-policy value-function es- timation, behavior and target policy are the same (πG = πB) and d matches the stationary distribution of the MDP with the policy to evaluate, that is, d = dπB = dπG. However, if the policies differ, the state distribution d = dπB = dπG is not the stationary distribution according to πG in general. The Example from Section 1.2 in Figure 1 shows such a case. 
All approaches to off-policy learning consider the difference of πG and πB for the actions at but leave the problem of the different stationary distributions unaddressed. Hence, off- policy value-function estimation does not yield the same result as on-policy estimation with samples taken from πG, even after convergence. For example, the fixpoint of methods minimizing the MSPBE in the off-policy case can be written as 
MSPBE(θ) = Vθ − ΠT πGVθ 2DπB. 
Hence, the difference of estimating the values with respect to policy πG from off-policy or on-policy samples is the norm of the objective function. The distance DπB may differ substantially and therefore yield different estimates, which metric may be Da πcritical G and

limitation of off-policy estimation. In the following, we use d = dπB to avoid cluttered notation. 
In addition, the use of importance reweighting on the policies requires πB(a|s) > 0 for all a ∈ A and s ∈ S with πG(a|s) > 0. Thus, each possible sample of the target policy should be observable with the behavior policy. In practice, the behavior policy is often an exploration policy and we aim for value-function estimation of a greedy policy. In this case, the restriction πB(a|s) > 0 is not violated. 
Let us now discuss specific extensions of TD learning and LSTD for off-policy learning. While we consider the algorithms without eligibility traces for notational simplicity, the derivations hold similarly for algorithms with multi-step predictions. In order to investigate the long-term behavior of algorithms, we have to consider their expected estimates, that is, their update rules in expectation of a transition (defined by the state distribution, the policy and the transition distribution). 
Off-Policy TD Learning. First, consider TD learning (Algorithm 1) with the expected parameter same updates update can be for obtained on-policy with learning samples according from πB to by πG rewriting 
given by EπG,P,dπG[δtφ(st)]. The

= EπB,P,dπB[ρtδtφ(st)]. 
The expectation w.r.t. the target policy πG turned into the expectation according to the behavior policy πB by including the importance weight ρt = πG(at|st)/πB(at|st). Hence, the off-policy update rule of TD learning is given by 
θt+1 = θt + αtρtδtφ(st). 
Note that on-policy learning can be treated as a special case with πG = πB and ρt = 1 for all timesteps t. As we will discuss in the following convergence analysis, TD learning might become unstable in off-policy learning. Other gradient methods have also been extended with off-policy weights and do not suffer from this drawback. The Algorithm listings in Appendix C already contain the off-policy weights for all gradient-based and least-squares algorithms. 
Convergence Analysis. TD learning may be unstable, when used with a sampling distri- bution for the states dπB that differs from the stationary state distribution dπG induced by the Markov model to evaluate PπG. Consider a batch gradient version of TD learning which 
846 
Policy Evaluation with Temporal Differences 
uses the expected gradient instead of the stochastic one. Results from stochastic approxi- mation theory guarantee that the TD learning algorithm converges if batch gradient descent converges and vice versa. In addition, their fixpoints are identical. A batch-gradient step can be written as 
θk+1 =θk + αE[δtφt] 
=θk + αE[(rt + γφTt+1θk − φTt θk)φt] =θk + αΦTD(R + γP πGΦθk − Φθk) =(I + αATD)θk + αbTD, (38) 
with ATD = ΦTD (γP πG − I)Φ and bTD = ΦTDR. 
The iterative update rule of Equation (38) converges if all eigenvalues of the matrix ATD have only negative real parts (Schoknecht, 2002). It can be shown that if D corresponds to the stationary distribution which has been generated by P πG this condition is satisfied, and hence, TD learning converges. However, this property of ATD is lost if D does not correspond to the stationary distribution, that is, dπB = P πGdπB and, hence, convergence can not be guaranteed for off-policy TD learning. Intuitively, TD learning does not converge because there is more weight on reducing the error of the value function for the starting states st of a transition than for the successor states st+1. Hence, the Bellman error in the successor states might increase, which again affects the estimation of the target values for the next parameter update. If d = P πGd, the successor states have the same probability of being updated, and this problem is hence alleviated. 
The second order equivalent of batch-gradient TD learning is LSPE. While both methods can be derived from the same nested optimization problem, LSPE is known to converge for off-policy policy evaluation. Hence, it is interesting to briefly look at the reason for this difference. The expected update of LSPE can be obtained from Equations (29) and (30) and is given by 
θk+1 =θk + α(ΦTDΦ)−1ΦTD (R + γP πGΦθk − Φθk) 
=(I + αALSPE)θk + αbLSPE, 
with ALSPE = (ΦTDΦ)−1ATD and bLSPE = (ΦTDΦ)−1bTD. We realize that LSPE scales the TD update with the inverse of a positive definite matrix. This scaling ensures that the matrix ALSPE stays negative definite and, hence, the update converges (Schoknecht, 2002). More intuitively, the second order term (ΦTDΦ)−1 normalizes the TD update by the average feature activation, and, hence, overrides the problem that the successor states st+1 have less probability mass than the starting states st of a transition. 
Off-policy LSTD. We will now discuss how to adapt least-squares approaches for off-policy learning. While we show the off-policy extension for the LSTD algorithm, other methods follow analogously. LSTD relies on the estimates At and bt from Equations (25) and (26) to converge to the true values A and b in Equation (24). In expectation, the estimates at 
847 
Dann, Neumann and Peters 
time t can be written as 
Ed,πG,P [At] = Ed 
[ ∑ti=0 
(φi − γEπG,P [φi+1])T] 
and 
Ed,πG,P [bt] = Ed,πG,P 
φi [ ∑ti=0 
φiri]. 
We realize that the only parts which depend on the policy πG are the terms EπG,P [φi+1] and Ed,πG,P [∑ti=0 φiri]. If a behavior policy πB is used instead of πG, these parts have to be re-weighted which results in 
Ed,πG,P [At] = Ed 
[ ∑ti=0 
[ππG(aB(ai|si|si) 
i)φi+1])T] 
and 
Ed,πG,P [bt] = Ed,πB,P 
(φi 
φi − γEπB,P [ ∑ti=0 
ππB(aG(ai|si|si) 
i)φiri]. 
For the sample-based implementation, we arrive at the off-policy parameter estimates of LSTD proposed by Bertsekas and Yu (2009) 
At = 
∑ti=0 
φi[φi − γρiφi+1]T, bt = 
∑tφiρiri. i=0 
We refer to this off-policy reweighting as Standard Off-Policy Reweighting. Taking eligibility traces into account and making use of the Sherman-Morrison formula (Equation 27), the recursive off-policy version of LSTD, shown in Algorithm 5 in Appendix C, can be derived (Scherrer and Geist, 2011; Geist and Scherrer, 2013). 
The φiφTi terms in At are not re-weighted since it is not necessary to add importance weights to terms which do not depend on the policy for ensuring convergence to the desired solution. However, as our experiments presented in Section 3.4 show, such an approach suffers from a severe drawback. To illustrate the reason, consider the effective number of samples the In used to calculate the different first term of At is always t while, expectation, ρ is equal to t and terms. The effective number for the second term, the effective the expected estimate of A of samples for calculating number is ρ is unbiased. However, = ∑ti for ρi. 
a specific sample-based realization, ρ will in general be different from t. As both terms in At are not normalized by the number of samples used for the estimate, a big part of the variance in estimating At will just come from the difference of ρ to t. Despite positive theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of this reweighting strategy (Bertsekas and Yu, 2009; Yu, 2010), our experiments reveal that for more complex problems, for example, in continuous domains, the performance of LSTD with this type of reweighting breaks down due to the drastically increased variance in At. Instead, the matrix At can be estimated more robustly by using the importance weight for the whole transition, that is, 
At = 
∑ti=0 
ρiφi[φi − γφi+1]T, bt = 
∑tφiρiri. i=0 
848 
Policy Evaluation with Temporal Differences 
A recursive method based on these updates, LSTD Transition Off-Policy Reweighting (LSTD- TO), is shown in Algorithm 6. Similar reweighting strategies can be formulated for LSPE which yields LSPE-TO shown in Algorithm 8. To the best of our knowledge, using a transition-based reweighting for LSTD and LSPE has not been introduced in the literature so far, but is crucial for the performance of off-policy learning with least-squares methods. 
3. Comparison of Temporal-Difference Methods 
In this section, we compare the performance and properties of the presented policy eval- uation methods quantitatively in various experiments. All algorithms were implemented in Python. The source code for each method and experiment is available at http:// github.com/chrodan/tdlearn. In addition, further supplementary material is available at http://www.ias.tu-darmstadt.de/Research/PolicyEvaluationSurvey. 
In Section 3.1, we present the experimental setting including the benchmark tasks and the evaluation process. Subsequently, the most important insights gained from the experimental evaluation are discussed. Section 3.2 focuses on results concerning cost functions, Section 3.3 concerning gradient-based methods and Section 3.4 covers results regarding least-squares methods. 
3.1 Benchmarks 
To evaluate the properties of policy evaluation methods under various conditions, we selected a number of representative benchmark tasks with different specifications. We computed the algorithms’ predictions with an increasing number of training data points, and compared their quality with respect to the MSE, MSBE and MSPBE. These experiments are performed on six different Markov decision processes, three with discrete and three with continuous state space. Most experiments were performed both with on-policy and off-policy samples. We also evaluated different feature representations which altogether resulted in the following 12 settings.

3.1.1 Boyan’s Chain (Benchmark 1) 
The first benchmark MDP is the classic chain example from Boyan (2002). We considered a chain of 14 states S = {s1,...,s14} and one action. Each transition from state si results in state si+1 or si+2 with equal probability and a reward of −3. If the agent is in the second last state s13, it always proceeds to the last state with reward −2 and subsequently stays in this state forever with zero reward. A visualization of a 7-state version of the Boyan chain is given in Figure 6. We chose a discount factor of γ = 0.95 and four-dimensional feature description with triangular-shaped basis functions covering the state space (Figure 13). The true value function, which is linearly decreasing from s1 to s14, can be represented perfectly. 
3.1.2 Baird’s Star Example (Benchmark 2) 
Baird’s star (Baird, 1995) is a well known example for divergence of TD learning in off- policy scenarios. It is often referred to as “star” MDP as its states can be ordered as a star, one central state and six states at the edges, as shown in Figure 15. There are two

actions. The solid action chooses one of the solid edges with equal probability and the dashed action always chooses the edge to the central state. We set the discount factor γ = 0.99 and assume zero reward for each transition. Hence, the true value function is zero in every state for all policies. The evaluation policy always takes the dashed action, and hence, goes to the central state. However, the behavior policy, that is, the policy used to generate the samples, chooses the solid action with probability 6/7. The feature vector has eight components. For the outside-states si, i = 2,...,7, the i-th entry has value 2 and the last entry is 1 (cf. Figure 15). All other entries are zero. The central state sets the first component of φ to 1 and the last component to 2. All other entries are again zero. We used θ0 = [1 1 1 1 1 1 10 1]T as initial parameter vector for the methods that allow specifying a start estimate. Although the true value function is zero everywhere, TD-learning is known to diverge for this initialization of the parameter-vector. 
3.1.3 Randomly Sampled MDP (Benchmarks 3 and 4) 
To evaluate the prediction in MDPs with more states and of a less constructed nature, we used a randomly generated discrete MDP with 400 states and 10 actions. The transition probabilities were distributed uniformly with a small additive constant to ensure ergodicity of the MDP, that is, 
P(s |a, s) ∝ pass + 10−5, pass ∼ U[0,1]. 
The data-generating policy, the target policy as well as the start distribution are sampled in a similar manner. The rewards are uniformly distributed, that is, r(si,aj) ∼ U[0,1]. Each state is represented by a 201-dimensional feature vector, 200 dimensions which have been generated by sampling from a uniform distribution and one additional constant feature. The MDP, the policies and the features are sampled once and then kept fix throughout all experiments (all independent trials were executed in the same setting). As behavior- and target-policy were generated independently and differ substantially for Benchmark 4,

the algorithms were tested in a difficult off-policy setting. The discount factor is set to γ = 0.95. 
3.1.4 Linearized Cart-Pole-Balancing (Benchmarks 5- 8) 
The Cart-Pole Balancing problem is a well known benchmark task which has been used for various reinforcement learning algorithms. As we want to know the perfect feature representation also for a continuous system, we linearized cart-pole dynamics and formulated the task as a linear system with a quadratic reward function and Gaussian noise. Linear- Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) systems are one of the few continuous settings for which we can compute the true value function exactly. The perfect features for the value function of a LQG system are all first and second order terms of the state vector s. 
Figure 14 visualizes the physical setting of the benchmark. A pole with mass m and length l is connected and left. The task to a cart of mass M. It can rotate is to balance the pole upright. The 360◦ and state s = the [ψ, cart ψ,  ̇can move right x,  ̇x]T consists of the angle of the pendulum ψ, its angular velocity ψ,  ̇the cart position x and its velocity  ̇x. The action a acts as a horizontal force on the cart. The system dynamics are given by (cf. Deisenroth, 2010, Appendix C.2 with ψ = θ + π)

where g is assumed = between 9.81 sm2 and b is a friction coefficient of the cart on the ground (no friction pole and cart). If the pole is initialized at the upright position and the policy is keeping the pole around this upright position, the system dynamics can be approximated yields sinψ ≈ ψ, accurately ψ ̇2 by linearizing the system at ψ = 0. ≈ 0 and cosψ ≈ 1 and we obtain the linear In this case, the linearization

where the time difference between two transitions is denoted by ∆t = 0.1s and z is Gaussian noise on the velocity of the cart with standard deviation 0.01. We set the length of the pole l to 0.6m, the mass of the cart M to 0.5kg, the mass of the pole m to 0.5kg and the friction coefficient of b to 0.1N(ms)−1. The reward function is given by 
R(s,a) = R(ψ, ψ,  ̇x,  ̇x, a) = −100ψ2 − x2 − 101a2, 
that is, deviations from the desired pole position are strongly penalized, while large offsets of the cart and the magnitude of the current action cause only minor costs. As the transition model is a Gaussian with a linear mean-function and the reward function is quadratic, the ex- act value function and optimal policy can be computed by dynamic programming (Bertsekas

where ∆t = 0.1s is the time difference of two time steps and M is the mass matrix in the upright position. Its entries are computed by Mih = l2(21 − max(i, h))m with length l = 5m and mass m = 1kg of each link. The matrix U is a diagonal matrix with entries U ii = −gl(21 − i)m. Each component of z contains Gaussian noise. Again, we used a quadratic reward function 
R(q,  ̇q,a) = −qTq, 
which penalizes deviations from the upright position. The target policy is given by the optimal policy (obtained by dynamic programming) with Gaussian noise and analogously the behavior policy but with increased noise level for the off-policy estimation case. A dis- count factor of γ = 0.95 and a 41-dimensional approximate feature representation φ(q,  ̇q) = [ψ21,ψ22,...,ψ220,  ̇ψ21,  ̇ψ22,...,  ̇ψ220,1]T were used in the experiments. 
3.1.6 Cart-Pole Swing-up (Benchmarks 9 and 10) 
Besides discrete and linear systems, we also include a non-linear problem, the cart-pole swing-up task. The non-linear system dynamics from Equations (39) and (40) were used and the constants were set to the same values as in the linearized task. The reward function directly rewards the current height of the pole and mildly penalizes offsets of the cart 
R(s,a) = R(ψ,  ̇ψ, x,  ̇x, a) = cos(ψ) − 10−5|x|. 
We used an approximately optimal policy learned with the PILCO-Framework (Deisenroth and Rasmussen, 2011) and added Gaussian noise to each action a. The resulting policy manages to swing-up and balance the pendulum in about 70% of the trials, depending on the initial pole position which is sampled uniformly. Each episode consists of 200 timesteps of 0.15s duration. A normalized radial basis function network and an additional constant feature has been chosen as feature representation. To obtain a compact representation, we first covered the four-dimensional state space with a grid of basis functions and then removed all features for which the summed activations were below a certain threshold. Thus, we omitted unused basis functions which are located in areas of the state space, which are not visited. The resulting feature vector had 295 dimensions. 
3.1.7 Hyper-Parameter Optimization 
The behavior of policy evaluation methods can be influenced by adjusting their hyper- parameters. We set those parameters by performing an exhaustive grid-search in the hyper- parameter space minimizing the MSBE (for the residual-gradient algorithm and BRM) or MSPBE. Optimizing for MSBE or MSPBE introduces a slight bias in the choice of the optimal parameters. For example, smaller value of λ for the eligibility traces are preferred as small values of λ as the objective bias is not taken into account. However, as opposed to the MSE, these objectives can be computed without knowledge of the true values, and, hence, can be evaluated also in practice on a small set of samples. We evaluated the algorithms for an increasing number of observed time steps and computed a weighted average over the errors of all considered time steps to obtain a single score per trial. We increased the weights from 1 for the first to 2 for the last estimate and therefore put emphasis on a good final value of the estimates but also promoted fast convergence. The scores of three independent trials

were averaged to obtain a more stable cost function during hyper-parameter grid-search. Table 4 provides a listing of all considered algorithms with their hyper-parameters. Each parameter in Table 4 is evaluated in the grid-search at the values listed in Table 3. 
All shown results are averages over 50 independent trials for continuous MDPs or 200 trials for discrete MDPs, if not stated otherwise. For discrete and linear continuous systems, the MSBE / MSPBE / MSE values were calculated exactly, whereas the stationary state distribution dπ is approximated by samples. For the non-linear continuous system, also the expectations inside the MSBE and MSPBE were approximated by samples while the true value function was estimated by exhaustive Monte-Carlo roll-outs.8 We often used the square-root of costs to present results in the following, which are denoted by RMSE, RMSBE or RMSPBE. 
3.1.8 Normalization of Features 
Two types of features were used in the continuous environments, the squared terms of the state s in the linear case, and a radial basis function network in the non-linear case. Both representations were normalized. For the squared terms, we subtracted the mean feature vector and divided by the standard deviation of the individual features. Hence, each feature was normalized to have zero-mean and unit variance. For the radial basis function representation, we always divided the activations of the radial basis functions by their sum, 
8. Ten roll-outs were used for each sample of the stationary distribution. We compared the Monte-Carlo estimates from ten roll-outs against estimates from 20 roll-outs on a small subset of samples but did not observe significant differences. Due to the high computational effort, we therefore settled for ten roll-outs per state.

that is, the sum of their activations is always 1. Since the feature function includes an additional constant feature 1, the total activation for each state s is φ(s) 1 = 2. Features in discrete settings were not normalized. 
3.2 Insights on the Algorithms-Defining Cost Functions 
The objective function of the policy evaluation algorithm determines its fixpoint, and, hence, largely influences the final quality of the predictions. As discussed in Section 2.1, only few theoretical results such as loose bounds could be derived. Additionally, constructed examples show that the quality of fixpoints with respect to the mean-squared error highly depends on the problem setting. Therefore, empirical comparisons of the MSTDE, MSBE and MSPBE fixpoints for common problems with different challenges are of particular interest. 
Message 1 Empirically, the magnitudes of the biases of different objective functions with respect to the MSE fixpoint are: bias(MSTDE) ≥ bias(MSBE) ≥ bias(MSPBE).

Table 5: Mean squared error values of fixpoints of other cost-functions: The fixpoints are estimated by the prediction of LSTD, BRM or BRM with double samples after convergence. The MSPBE has the lowest bias in almost all experiments. 
Table 5 shows the observed MSE value of each fixpoint for every benchmark problem. We estimated the MSBE, MSTDE and MSPBE fixpoints by running either the Bellman residual minimization algorithm with or without double sampling or LSTD until convergence (up to a certain accuracy, without eligibility traces). While this procedure introduces approximation errors, which are not entirely neglectable, it still allows us to compare the fixpoints of the cost functions. We ensured that regularization did not impair with the results by comparing the fixpoint estimations for different regularization parameters. 
The results confirm the findings of Scherrer (2010) on discrete MDPs. The MSPBE fixpoint yields a lower MSE than the MSBE in all continuous experiments. MSTDE and MSBE are observed to generate substantially inferior predictions, often with errors almost twice as big. While the MSTDE usually yields the worst predictions, the difference to the MSBE depends on the amount of stochasticity in each transition. For example, both are almost identical on the swing-up task due to low noise in the policy and the MDP. While the MSPBE and MSBE fixpoints are identical to the MSE fixpoint for experiments with perfect feature representations (up to numerical issues, Benchmarks 1,2,7,8), the MSTDE fixpoint is often substantially different (Benchmarks 1,7,8). The problem of a potential dramatic failure of the MSPBE solution, as sketched by Scherrer (2010), was not encountered throughout all evaluations. 
Message 2 Optimizing for the MSBE instead of MSTDE by using double samples introduces high variance in the estimate. Particularly, Bellman residual minimization requires stronger regularization which results in slower convergence than relying on one sample per transition. 
The objective function does not only determine the objective bias but also affects the sampling error (see Figure 10). Using double samples, that is, optimizing for MSBE instead of MSTDE, decreases the objective bias, however, our experiments show that the second

sample per transition is not the only price to pay. To determine whether the sampling error for the two objectives is different, we compared the online performance of residual-gradient algorithm (RG) and Bellman residual minimization (BRM) with or without double sampling (DS). We have observed that double-sampling variants converge significantly slower, that is, their predictions have higher variance. The effect is particularly present in MDPs with high variance such as the random discrete MDPs, see Figure 17. Double-sampling algorithms require stronger regularization and therefore converge slower. Bellman residual minimization suffers more from this effect than the residual-gradient algorithm. 
Message 3 Interpolating between the MSPBE/MSTDE and the MSE with eligibility traces can improve the performance of policy evaluation. 
In Example 2 in Section 2.4.1, we illustrated the benefits of eligibility traces with a specially tailored MDP for which we could control its stochasticity easily. The question remains whether the interpolation between the MSE and MSPBE is also useful for noise levels in MDPs encountered in practice. Is the noise so large that the variance is always the domi- nant source of error or does reducing the bias with eligibility traces pays off? We therefore compared the MSE of LSTD(λ) and TD(λ) predictions for different λ values on several benchmark tasks. Representative results of LSTD, shown in Figure 18b, confirm that eligi- bility traces are of no use if no bias is present in the MSPBE due to perfect features. The same holds for systems with large stochasticity such as in the randomly sampled discrete MDP shown in Figure 18c. Yet, interpolating between the MSPBE and MSE boosts the performance significantly if the MSPBE introduces a bias due to an imperfect feature repre- sentation and the variance of the MDP is not too high. Such behavior is shown in Figure 18a, where we used the approximate features instead of the perfect feature representation. 
Similar to LSTD, TD learning can be improved by eligibility traces as shown for the linearized cart pole balancing benchmark with imperfect features in Figure 19a. Best pre-

The colormaps are log log-normalized, that is, the absolute difference in the dark regions are smaller than those in the bright areas. The regularization parameter ε is plotted logarithmically on the vertical axis and the eligibility traces parameter λ on the horizontal one. 
dictions are obtained with 0.1 <λ< 0.5 depending on the step-size α. Yet, different to LSTD, TD learning also benefits from eligibility traces for perfect features (see Figure 19b). They speed up learning by reducing the optimization error of gradient-based approaches (cf. Figure 10) and make the algorithms more robust to the choice of the step-size. These benefits are also present in systems with high stochasticity as Figure 19c indicates. While eligibility traces diminishes the prediction quality of LSTD in such highly stochastic systems, TD learning works best for all λ settings as long as the step-size is set appropriately. 
3.2.1 Double Sampling vs. Eligibility Traces 
Both, double sampling and eligibility-traces, can be used to reduce the bias of the MSTDE objective at the price of higher variance. However, which approach works better in practice? To shed some light on this matter, we compared BRM with and without double sampling and BRM with eligibility traces. The results for the cart-pole balancing task with imperfect features (Benchmark 5) are shown in Figure 20. We chose the λ-parameter such that both approaches have the same convergence speed, that is, comparable variance. The plot shows that eligibility traces can reduce the bias of the MSTDE more than double sampling at the same increase of variance. 
3.2.2 MSPBE vs. MSE Performance 
During our evaluation, we often made the interesting observation that a prediction with significantly lower MSPBE than another prediction does not necessarily have a significantly lower MSE. See Figure 21 for such an example, which shows the MSE and MSPBE of predictions for the randomly sampled discrete MDP (Benchmark 3). The performance of

LSTD and TDC or TD is very different with respect to the MSPBE but they perform almost identically w.r.t. the MSE. While this observation does not always hold (compare for example RG and LSTD), we experienced similar effects in many experiments including continuous MDPs. 
3.3 Results on Gradient-based Methods 
In this section, we present the most important observations for gradient-based methods. 
861 
Dann, Neumann and Peters 
Message 4 Normalization of the features is crucial for the prediction quality of gradient- based temporal-difference methods. 
Throughout all experiments, we observed that normalizing the feature representation im- proves, or least does not harm, the performance of all temporal-difference methods. However, for gradient-based approaches, feature normalization is crucial for a good performance. Fea- tures can be normalized per time step, for example, all components of the feature vector φt sum up to one, or per dimension, for example, each feature is shifted and scaled such that it has mean zero and variance one. Per-time-step normalization is, for example, typically used in radial basis function networks (see Benchmark 11 and 12) to ensure that each time step has the same magnitude of activation and consequently all transition samples have the same weight. As such, its effect resembles that of using natural gradients (Amari, 1998; a discus- sion of the relation between using the Hessian and natural gradients is provided by Roux and Fitzgibbon, 2010). Since the gradient varies less for different states with per-time-step normalization, the actual distribution of states is less important and the estimate becomes more robust for finitely many samples. 
Per-dimension normalization gives each feature comparable importance. Under the as- sumption that the value function changes similarly fast in each feature dimension, per- dimension normalization causes the Hessian matrix to become more isotropic. It has there- fore an effect similar to using the inverse of the Hessian to adjust the gradient as least-squares methods do. However, least-squares methods still can benefit from such a normalization since their regularization has more equate effect on all dimensions. 
We compared per-dimension normalized (Figure 22a) and unnormalized features (Fig- ure 22b) for the cart-pole balancing task. The results show that the performance of gradient- based approaches degrade drastically without normalization. As this benchmark requires only little regularization, the performance of least-squared methods is not significantly af- fected by feature normalization. To understand why normalization plays such an important role for gradient-based methods, consider the MSPBE function in an unnormalized feature space. It may correspond to a quadratic loss function which is flat along some dimension and steep in others, that is, its Hessian contains large and small eigenvalues. Hence, the optimal step-size for gradient descent algorithms can vary significantly per dimension, resulting in either slow convergence of gradient-based algorithms with small step-sizes or a bias if larger step-sizes are used, see, for example, TDC in Figure 22b. 
Message 5 GTD performs worse than its successors GTD2 and TDC. TDC minimizes the MSPBE faster than the other gradient-based algorithms GTD, GTD2 and TD learning. 
We assessed the ability of the gradient based methods TD learning, GTD, GTD2 and TDC to minimize the MSPBE. The results are given in Table 6. Each entry corresponds to the accumulated √MSPBE-values of the predictions for all time steps. Low numbers indicate ac- curate estimates with small number of samples. We observe that the performance of GTD is always worse than the performance of the other methods except for the Boyan chain (Bench- mark 1) and the 20-link Pole Balancing Off-policy task (Benchmark 12). GTD2 converged very slowly in these two experiments. Throughout all tasks, GTD performs significantly worse than other approaches and yields unreliable results in general, that is, sometimes the

estimates have a drastically higher error (Benchmark 1, 5, 6). TDC outperformed all other gradient-based methods in minimizing the MSPBE throughout all tasks. 
Message 6 If we optimize the hyper-parameters of TDC, TDC is always at least as good as TD-learning, but comes at the price of optimizing an additional hyper-parameter. Often, hyper-parameter optimization yields very small values for the second learning rate β, in which case TDC reduces to TD-learning.

As TDC is identical to TD if we set the second learning rate β for the vector w (or the ratio μ = β/α) to zero, the performance of TDC is at least as good as that of TD if the hyper-parameters are optimized. As the results in Table 6 show, the difference of TDC and TD is negligible in some tasks (Tasks 1, 5, 6). In these cases, the optimal values for the ratio μ are very small, as the results of the grid-search in Figure 23b indicate, and TDC reduces to TD. 
Large μ values were only observed to yield good performance for the Baird’s Star task (Benchmark 2) where TD learning always diverged (see Figure 23d). Apart from this ex- ample, which is specifically tailored to show divergence of TD learning, TD converged in all off-policy benchmarks. However, even if TD learning converges, the use of the second step- size can be beneficial in some scenarios (e.g., in Benchmark 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10), as the MSPBE of the predictions can be reduced significantly. The grid search results of the Swing-up task shown in Figure 23a as well as the prediction error over time shown in Figure 24b clearly indicate an advantage of TDC. However, TDC comes at the price that we need to optimize the second learning rate as an additional hyper-parameter despite that it may have almost no effect in some problems (see Figure 23c).864

3.3.1 Constant vs. Decreasing Learning Rates 
We also evaluated whether using a decreasing learning rate—an assumption on which the convergence proofs of stochastic gradient-based methods rely—improves the prediction per- formance for a finite number of time steps. We compared constant learning rates against exponentially decreasing ones (see C and D in Table 4) for TD learning. In most tasks, no significant improvements with decreasing rates could be observed. Only for the cart pole balancing with imperfect features (Benchmark 6) and the discrete random MDP (Bench- mark 3), we could speed up the convergence to low-error predictions. Figure 24 illustrates the difference. However, using decreasing learning rates is harder as at least two parameters per learning rate need to be optimized, which we experienced to have high influence on the prediction quality, and, hence, we do not recommend to use decreasing step-sizes for a limited number of observations. 
3.3.2 Influence of Hyper-Parameters 
We can consider the prediction error of each method as a function of the method’s hyper- parameters. As Figure 19 and Figure 23 indicate, these functions are smooth, uni-modal and often even convex for gradient-based algorithms.9 Only parts of the hyper-parameter spaces are shown, yet, we observed the functions to be well-behaved in general, and, hence, local optimization strategies for selecting hyper-parameters can be employed successfully.

In this section, we present the most important insights from the experimental evaluation of least-squares methods.

Table 7: Mean squared errors of final predictions. Task names and descriptions associated with the numbers can be found in Section 3.1. LSPE and LSTD are shown with transition-based off-policy reweighting (LSPE-TO and LSTD-TO). 
Message 7 In general, LSTD and LSPE produce the predictions with lowest errors for sufficiently many observations. 
Table 7 shows the square roots of mean-squared errors (√MSE) of the estimate from each method at the last timestep. The values are the final errors obtained with specific methods for each benchmark. The best prediction is generated either by LSTD or LSPE for almost all tasks. In cases where LSPE has the lowest error, LSTD is only marginally worse and does not depend on a learning rate α to be optimized. 
The Star Example of Baird has a true value function of constant 0 and is therefore not suited to compare least-squares methods. Each least-squares method can yield perfect results with overly strong regularization. The small difference between the errors of BRM and LSTD in the second row of Table 7 are caused by numerical issues avoidable by stronger regularization. 
Interestingly, BRM outperforms all other methods in Benchmark 4, the randomly gen- erated discrete MDP with off-policy samples. The MSTDE has a high bias but at the same time a low variance which seems to be particularly advantageous here as this benchmark is highly stochastic. We experienced unexpected results for the cart-pole balancing tasks with imperfect features (Tasks 5 and 6). Here, the gradient-based approaches perform exceed- ingly well and GTD even obtains the lowest final MSE value. However, Figure 25 reveals that the reason for this effect is only an artifact of the optimization error introduced by gradient methods. The two sources of error, objective bias and optimization error, coun- terbalance each other in this example. The MSPBE fixpoint has an error of about 2.5 and LSTD converges to it quickly. The gradient methods, however, converge slower due to their optimization error. Yet, when they approach the MSPBE fixpoint, the estimates pass through regions with lower MSE. As GTD has not converged for the maximum number of evaluated observations, it is still in the region with lower MSE. It therefore yields the best

final prediction. However, it would eventually converge to the worse MSPBE fixpoint. Un- fortunately, we typically do not have knowledge when such a coincidence happens without actually evaluating the MSE, and, thus, can not exploit this effect. Apart from Tasks 4, 5 and 6, LSTD always yields the lowest or almost the lowest errors, while other methods perform significantly worse on at least some benchmarks (e.g., Task 10 for LSPE). According to the results of our experiments, LSTD is a very accurate and reliable method. It is the method of our choice, although it may behave unstable in some cases, for example, when the number of observations is less than the number of features or some features are redundant, that is, linearly dependent. 
Message 8 In practice, LSTD and LSPE perform well with off-policy samples only if the newly introduced transition reweighting (proposed in Section 2.4.2) is used. The variance of LSTD with standard reweighting makes the algorithm unusable in practice. 
In Section 2.4.2, we proposed an off-policy reweighting based on the entire transition as an al- ternative to the standard off-policy sample reweighting for LSTD and LSPE. Both reweight- ing strategies converge to the same solution for infinitely many observations. However, transition reweighting yields much faster convergence as Figure 26 illustrates. Figure 26a compares the reweighting approaches on the linearized cart-pole problem (Benchmark 6). Despite strong l2-regularization, LSTD yields very noisy estimates with standard reweight- ing, rendering the algorithm inapplicable. The variance induced by the standard reweighting prevents fast convergence, as the variance of 1.0 between different experiment runs indicates. While the estimates of LSPE with standard reweighting show decreasing error over time (due to a very small step size chosen by the hyper-parameter optimization), the increasing stan- dard deviation indicates that the variance of the estimates is problematic. In contrast, LSPE and LSTD with transition reweighting converge substantially faster and yield good estimates after already 5,000 time steps. The benefit of transition reweighting is even more salient in the results of the off-policy cart-pole swing-up task (Benchmark 10) shown in Figure 26b on a logarithmic scale. The observations are consistent with all off-policy tasks (see Table 8). The price for using off-policy samples instead of on-policy samples, in terms of convergence

speed, is similar to other methods if LSTD and LSPE are used with transition reweight- ing. LSTD and LSPE with transition reweighting obtain the most accurate estimates of all methods as Table 7 indicates. 
Message 9 For a modest number of features, least-squares methods are superior to gradient- based approaches both in terms of data-efficiency and even CPU-time if we want to reach the same error level. For a very large number of features (e.g., ≥ 20,000), gradient-based meth- ods should be preferred as least-squares approaches become prohibitively time- and memory- consuming. 
Except for the artifact in the linearized cart-pole balancing task with imperfect features (Benchmarks 5 and 6), least-squares methods yield the most accurate final predictions (see Table 7). However, least-squares approaches may behave very unstable for a small number of

observations. A strong regularization is usually required if the number of samples is smaller than the number of features. An example is given in Figure 17 that shows the increase of the error of BRM predictions for the first 500 samples. However, Figures 22a, 21, 17 and 25 show that least-squares approaches converge much faster than gradient-based methods after this stage of potential instability. Least-squares methods are therefore more data efficient than gradient-based methods. 
However, the required CPU-time per transition is quadratic in the number of features instead of linear as for the gradient approaches. Hence, it is also interesting to compare both approaches from a computational viewpoint with a fixed budget of CPU-time. Figure 27 compares the prediction quality of LSTD and TDC, the best-performing representatives of both classes, for a given budget of CPU-time. In order to compare the performance on a task with a vast number of features, we changed the number of dimensions in the pendulum balancing task from 20 to 100 and used the perfect feature representation of 20101 dimensions.10 LSTD requires more CPU time to converge since TDC can do several sweeps through the provided transition samples (7000 in total) while LSTD can update the parameters only a few times due to the high-dimensional features. Yet, TDC converges faster only up to an error level of approximately 8, both for constant and decreasing step-sizes. The prediction error of TDC with decreasing step-sizes still decreases, and will eventually reach the same minimum as the one of LSTD, but very slowly. This observation is consistent with results on stochastic gradient methods in general (see Sra et al., 2012, Chapter 4.1.2). Additionally, we evaluated the methods on a 30-link pendulum with a moderate number of 1830 features. The results are shown in Figure 27b. Due to the smaller number of features LSTD converges faster from the beginning on. However, as the stagnant prediction error up to second 30 shows, LSTD may still yield unstable results as it has not processed enough observations to ensure that its At-matrix (cf. Equation 25) is invertible and needs strong regularization. 
Least-squares methods clearly outperform gradient-based approaches for problems with few features. The quadratic run-time and memory consumption as well as the unstable behavior with few observations become more problematic for increasing numbers of features but, as our results show, least-squares methods may still be a good option for up to 20.000 features 
3.4.1 Alternative Regularization Approaches 
We implemented and evaluated alternative regularization approaches for LSTD in prelimi- nary experiments, including LARS-TD, LSTD with l2,l1, LSTD-l1 and D-LSTD. However, we observed no performance gain for our benchmarks in comparison to l2-regularization. We attribute this result to the fact that most of the features in our benchmarks had sufficient quality. The sparse solutions produced by alternative regularization schemes had thus no significant advantage as the noise introduced by active low-quality features in non-sparse solutions was not large enough. We also did not observe the theoretically derived benefits of LSTD with random projections (LSTD-RP), which only become important for extremely many features.

The results are averages of 10 independent runs executed on a single core of an i7 Intel CPU. 
3.4.2 Dependency on Hyper-Parameters 
Most least-squares methods are robust against a poor choice of the hyper-parameters. LSTD and BRM, in particular, which are controlled only by the regularization parameter ε and the parameter λ of the eligibility-traces, converge for almost all values (cf. Figure 18). In contrast, FPKF has four hyper-parameters to optimize, the eligibility-trace parameter λ; a general scaling factor αFPKF for the step-sizes; βFPKF delaying the decrease of the step-length and τFPKF which controls the minimum number of observations necessary to update the estimate. In particular, αFPKF and βFPKF need to be set correctly to prevent FPKF from diverging as the large white areas in Figure 28a indicate. Also, τFPKF has large influence on the performance and may cause divergence (Figure 28b). Hence, descent-based optimization strategies such as block gradient descent (with finite differences) are difficult to use for hyper-parameter search as choosing an initial hyper-parameter setting that works is not trivial. On the contrary, LSPE does not rely as much on well-chosen hyper-parameters. As LSTD and BRM, it has an eligibility-traces parameter λ and a regularization-intensity ε, but also incorporates a step-size α, which affects the prediction in a similar way as ε, that is, it controls the amount of learning. Representative results, given in Figure 29, illustrate that LSPE performs well and stable up to a certain step-size but then diverges. Still, LSTD does not require any step-size at all and performs similarly or better than LSPE (see also Message 7).

4. Conclusion and Outlook 
We conclude the paper with a short summary of its main contributions and a brief outlook on possible directions for future research on temporal-difference methods. 
4.1 Conclusion 
With this paper, we aimed at giving an exhaustive survey of past and current research activities on value-function estimation with temporal differences—both from a theoretical and an empirical point of view. Almost all important methods originated in this area of research have been presented from a unifying viewpoint of function optimization. The algorithms have been systematically categorized based on their underlying cost functions and the employed optimization technique: stochastic gradient descent, analytic least-squares solutions or a probabilistic problem formulation. We aimed for a concise, yet comprehensive and coherent presentation to make these algorithms available to novices and practitioners. 
In addition, we provide an overview over recent work on feature representations for value function approximation. These developments aim either at an automatic generation of state features or at more robust methods that can deal with very large numbers of irrelevant features. We also have provided a qualitative analysis of conceptual error sources that aids novices in understanding the effects of eligibility traces which implicitly perform multi-step look-ahead. Discerning the sources of errors is important for choosing the most suitable estimation method given a new task at hand and for identifying reasons why a particular approach might not work. Furthermore, we have discussed the use of importance reweighting for implementing off-policy value estimation. We have shown that the commonly employed importance reweighting strategy of least-squares methods such as LSTD and LSPE is un- suitable for non-trivial tasks due to its high variance. To alleviate this problem, we have introduced a novel importance reweighting strategy with drastically reduced variance. Our importance reweighting strategy works well in practice—even where the standard reweight- ing strategy exhibits strong instabilities and yields unsuitable results. 
One of the most important contribution of this paper is that it is one of the first com- prehensive experimental comparisons of the different value-function estimation methods, including the recent developments. Their performance was evaluated on 12 different bench- mark tasks that exhibited different characteristics, including MDPs with continuous and discrete state spaces as well as on- and off-policy transition samples. Our work also provides further evidence on relevant future research questions, such as, which objective function has the lowest bias in practice or which algorithms are preferable in terms of data efficiency or computational demands. Moreover, the experimental evaluation reveals the behavior and the limitations of each temporal-difference method in various scenarios. These findings will hopefully give insights for improving the state of the art in policy evaluation. 
4.2 Outlook 
Efficient estimation of value functions is a corner stone of reinforcement learning as the value function is needed in the policy improvement step of the many reinforcement learning algorithms. Temporal-difference methods have been used since the late 1980s to estimate the value function of a policy and have since then been an active field of research. In recent 
872 
Policy Evaluation with Temporal Differences 
years, the research concentrated on overcoming the instability of the TD learning method with off-policy samples, improving the sample efficiency, or value-function estimation in high-dimensional feature spaces. This research resulted in the development of the current state of the art, such as LSTD or TD learning with Gradient Correction. In addition, the theoretical analysis from different view-points has led to a good theoretical understanding of the foundations of temporal-difference methods. 
However, the use of temporal-difference methods has been restricted by several limita- tions of the methods. In many domains, the assumption of having a compact and informative feature representation is not realistic. Such features are often difficult to define by hand, for example, in real world robotic systems, in health care diagnosis or for controlling of prostheses. We therefore expect the recent efforts of learning the feature representation (cf. Section 2.3) to continue and increase substantially. 
Additionally, the number of samples necessary for learning value functions is still pro- hibitively large for many real-world scenarios, especially those that involve hardware such as robots or other complex, expensive equipment. One way for addressing this shortcoming is to make the learning problem easier by incorporating prior knowledge. Domain knowledge can usually be incorporated most easily in model-based methods that learn the underlying forward dynamics of the task. Such models can be used to create samples in simulation with- out hardware or by directly using dynamic programming with the learned model. Deisenroth and Rasmussen (2011) successfully learned complex robot control policies by simultaneously learning a system model and using this model to optimize the policy (direct model-based policy search). As their work show, it is crucial to include the uncertainty about the learned model into the actual estimation problem. Value-function estimation methods that can in- corporate a learned model and its uncertainty efficiently are therefore a promising direction for future research. 
In this paper, we have treated minimizing the mean squared error of a value function estimate as the ultimate goal. However, in most cases the value function is only an inter- mediate result used for improving the policy. What counts in the end is not the quality of the value function approximation but the quality of the policy after the policy improvement step. Other objective functions might exist that are easier to minimize and do not harm the convergence properties of policy iteration schemes. Characterizing such objectives can prospectively lead to algorithms with faster convergence to an optimal or at least viable policy. 
This survey and comparison solely concentrated on policy evaluation. A comprehensive survey and experimental evaluation of temporal differences in policy iteration which builds on the results of this paper is left as future work and strongly needed by the reinforcement learning community.

Appendix A. Derivation of Least-Squares Temporal-Difference Learning 
The derivation of the LSTD algorithm begins with rewriting the MSPBE from Equation (9) in terms of a different norm. While this formulation is, strictly speaking, not necessary, it helps to understand the connection to the TDC, GTD and GTD2 algorithms and let us derive subsequent steps more concisely 
MSPBE(θ) = V θ − ΠT πV θ 2D 
= Π(V θ − T πV θ) 2D (since V θ is parametrizable) = [Π(V θ − T πV θ)]TD[Π(V θ − T πV θ)] = [V θ − T πV θ]TΠTDΠ[V θ − T πV θ] = [V θ − T πV θ]TDΦ(ΦTDΦ)−1ΦTDΦ(ΦTDΦ)−1ΦTD[V θ − T πV θ] = [V θ − T πV θ]TDΦ(ΦTDΦ)−1ΦTD[V θ − T πV θ] = [ΦTD(V θ − T πV θ)]T(ΦTDΦ)−1[ΦTD(V θ − T πV θ)] = ΦTD(V θ − T πV θ) 2(ΦT DΦ)−1 (41) = Ed,π,P[φtδt] 2(ΦT DΦ)−1. (42) 
The matrix ΦTDΦ and its inverse M = (ΦTDΦ)−1 are symmetric positive definite matrices (for independent features and d(s) > 0,∀s ∈ S). Hence, · M is a norm and θ minimizes the MSPBE if and only if Ed,π,P[φtδt] = 0. Equation (42) also allows us to rewrite the MSPBE as a product of expectations 
MSPBE(θ) = Ed,π,P[φtδt]TEd[φtφTt ]−1Ed,π,P[φtδt], (43) 
which is the basis for the GTD2 and TDC algorithms. Since Vθ is parameterized linearly, we can replace TπV θ with 
TπV θ = R + γΦ θ, 
where R ∈ Rn is the expected intermediate reward Ri = Eπ[r(si,a)] in state si and Φ = P πΦ is the matrix containing the expected feature for the successor states, that is, Φ i = EP,π[φTt+1|st = si]. Equation (41) can then be written as 
MSPBE(θ) = ΦTD(Φθ − γΦ θ − R) 2M 
= ΦTD[Φ − γΦ ]θ − ΦTDR) 2M = ΦTD∆Φθ − ΦTDR) 2M = Aθ − b 2M, 
where ∆Φ = Φ − γΦ and b = ΦTDR. The matrix A = ΦTD∆Φ has been shown to be positive definite and thus invertible (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996, Proposition 6.3.3). Minimizing this MSPBE formulation directly by setting the gradient to 0 yields 
θ = (ATMA)−1ATMb = A−1M−1A−TATMb = A−1b = (ΦTD∆Φ)−1ΦTDR.

Equation (32) can also be written in matrix form in terms of the reward, that is, 
rt−1 = ΓtV t + nt, Γt = 
 
, 
where Γt connects the values of subsequent timesteps, rt−1 = [r1,...,rt−1] and V t = [v1 ...vt]. The noise term nt is now given as nt = Γt∆vt, and hence is distributed as nt ∼ N(0,Σt), with 
Σt = σ2ΓtΓTt = σ2 
1 −γ 0 ... 0 0 1 −γ ... 0 ... ... 0 ... 0 1 −γ 
 
. 
We realize that the required whitening transformation is given by 
Zt = Γ−1 t = 
1 + γ2 −γ 0 ... 0 −γ 1 + γ2 −γ ... 0 ... ... 
0 0 ... −γ 1 + γ2 


and hence, we get the following regression problem 
Ztrt−1 = ZtΓtV t + Ztnt.

Temporal and Political Analysis of Financial Transformation in Higher Education in Turkey* 
Dr. Ali Ilker Kurt** Ministry of National Education Turkey 
Abstract 
In this study, the effects of neo liberal policies that are applied after the 1980’s and negatively affected presentation of public services on change/transformation of higher education system in Turkey are examined. Within the scope of change/transformation in finance of universities from past to present due to the university concept imposed by fast growing capitalism in global, dynamics of change/transformation in universities of Turkey, historical background of finance of higher education, developments realized within the framework of finance are tried to be defined deriving from the thoughts temporal/chronological changes of public spending on higher education and thoughts of administrators of universities on change/transformation in finance of universities. In order to determine the financial changes in universities in Turkey post 1980, public spending on higher education between 1938-2012 was pointed out as well as increase ratios in public spending between 1981-2012 were compared. Besides, in order to define neo liberal policies effects on universities creating their own incomes in Turkey, total incomes of universities during 1947-2012 were revealed. The process of universities’ creating their own incomes was conceptualized as “Self Income”. Within this context, by pointing out temporal development of self income that takes growing ratio in total income, the levels of universities in terms of creating their own income was tried to be presented. 
Key Words: Finance of higher education, public education spending, capital and transfer spending, self-income.

Analysis of Financial Transformation in Higher Education Introduction 
Heraclitus, living from 535-574 B.C, had brought a very distinctive approach for the source of knowledge and had focused on “action” as the source of knowledge. He had drawn attention to the “essence” with his well-known sayings implying the continuous change of life such as “no man ever steps in the same river twice”. When this matter is taken into consideration with regards to higher education, the direction of change/transformation, how the quality and right to public education is affected, state’s approach to the higher education and how this approach affect the spending policy, how this change/transformation affect/may affect the large sections of the community are crucially important to reach the ideal of democratic society. Today, it is seen that university’s dimension of creating qualified manpower is relatively more important than its other aims. Giroux (2009) argues that the universities, in capitalist formation, are seen as places where professional competency is gained and thus they have turned into vocational schools. By stating that this situation narrows the prospect of the universities and precludes the scientific development, Giroux implies that a dire tableau is emerged where the university, day by day, is becoming indifferent to the ideal of empowering the democratic communal living potential, and it is being forgotten that the academy has a significant role to improve the communal support and casework. Giroux, stressing that the higher education must be the communal centre of criticism, puts forward the idea that the university, with its present situation, has lost its function of being the communal centre of criticism (Giroux, 2009: 34). Giroux (2009), conceptualizing today’s university as “Neoliberal University”, stresses that critical intellectuals should uphold the public space which is being removed day by day against the neoliberal university model. 
Giroux, stating that the education given at universities is only a dimension of the whole work (2008: 38), argues that the university, at the same time, is a vital, institutional, and political platform to allow the democratic subjects form themselves, to experience democratic relation patterns, and to criticize the government by revealing its anti-democratic and oppressive manner. On the other hand, John and Parsons (2004: 8) attribute the reasons of the failure of theoretical assessment of public education at higher education to some conditions of universities and emphasize that the political stance of today’s university and its quality to react against the outer world is a mythos. He implies that one of the reasons of this situation is the political process choosing administers at the universities. As a result of this process, administers at the universities in the 20th century are bound to meet the political demands and try to influence government’s decision about the universities they work for Wright, Cory-Scruggs and King (2009: 59) state that the uncertainty at financing the state universities will gradually grow in the first decade of the 21st century and the universities, so as to overcome the uncertainty at funding, will have to tend towards the domestic and external sources to continue funding their activities, and apply to alternative ways in order to create administrative and financial sources such as increasing the tuition fees, organizing income-generating activities at administrative and faculty level, cutting the spending for the staff, using different applications at deciding the tuition fees. 
Recently, the preparation of the new higher education law in Turkey has been in progress. The proposed law draft implies to reform the administrative structure of the universities in Turkey in accordance with new liberal policies, and activating a marketing understating at the universities is being tried with financial arrangements. Aksoy (2012) describes the proposed law as capital’s repealing the university and states as: 
Nothing is taken into consideration to limit the capital in the new law draft. It includes the Constitution, other laws, the university understanding of academicians and society, the struggle the humanity has been giving for ages to deprivatize and democratize the knowledge, the efforts driven by the ethic and communal responsibility feeling of the academic community. Even in the first articles of high order teaching - which is contradictory with the Constitution and basic university concepts but is brought without being escaped from the idea that reading and spending time for a text, which is evidently suits to the spirit of neoliberal time, is useless – it is expected that it will be applied by the representatives of government and capital to serve the market power such as competition and quality. 
It is significant to determine the finance policies, financial notions and tools and their suitability for this purpose or how efficient they can be so as to reach the aims such as to create university as a criticism center which is a necessity for the university, to make it one of the subjects at the administration of the country and to reinforce its position as such. It is vital to detect the cases that financially hinders the universities directly or indirectly from functioning as institutions that enrich the democracy. 
The Higher Education Law draft tends towards totally transforming and “evaporating” the principles such as scientific freedom, academic-financial- administrative autonomy which are hoped to survive at universities (Aksoy, 2012). Balaban and Karahanoğulları (2013) who took the financial aspects of the draft have stated that the new Higher Education Law might bring new regulations for the student fees via university councils and the student fees may be reconsidered, and the provisions related with resource diversity may cause new problems. The Outcomes of New Liberal Policies in Higher Education 
In literature, there are many studies which have been done in almost every country by many different writers and have implied that there has been a remarkable change in the finance of the higher education (Tilak, 2002; John, Parsons, 2004; Jhonstone and Marcucci, 2010; Heller, 2006, Asonuma, 2002). As Ünal (1985) also stated that the regulations upon the finance is the focus of this change. Unesco (2009: 67), Jhonstone & Marcucci (2010) argued that two phenomena in the finance of the higher education are dominant in the first decade of the 21st century. First, they stressed that the higher education, in social context, has been increasingly becoming important in respect to economy, individualization and democracy, and social justice. Second, the cost of the higher education has been significantly increasing. It was expressed that popularization, demographic causes, the rising number of high school graduates, the will to have a university education, educational and research activities have increased the cost of education (Jhonstone, Marcucci, 2010). Despite the increase in the cost of education, it has been observed that the public spending has universally been on decline. 
Heller (2006) stated that the total student number in the US increased from 9.4 million to 12.3 million from 1980’s to 2003. Although the state has continued to financially support the higher education, it has been indifferent to the increasing number of students. The cost of education has been a burden on the students and their families. 
The commodification of education necessitated production for the exchange value of itself. Any transformation in the aim of production leads a change for all equipment providing this production. After a decrease in public support for it, education which is motivated by the feelings of profit and charity returns the school to a market place, and a race of charity (Council, 2012: 338). It may be said that the negative impacts of new liberal politics in higher education can be analysed in two main areas. First, the impact of the reduction of the sources; second, the impact of commercialisation of higher education. Jhonstone and Marcucci (2010: 31) discuss the impact of the reduction of the sources in the higher education under a few headings. 
First of these is the impacts on the universities and other institutions. These are the matters such as crowded classrooms and conference halls, heavy course load on the faculty members, insufficient libraries, computers and communication devices which are not updated, disrupted physical atmosphere, giving less time and support for the research, deterioration of quality at teaching and learning, and waste of grants. 
The second one is the impacts on national higher education system. They are the capacity limitation, insufficient regulations, closing up some invaluable faculties due to financial problems, and weak participation to the global economy of knowledge. 
Third of this can be listed as students’ facing with tuition fees directly, rising costs of studentship, the need for working to meet these needs or debt spiral as a result of these needs. Students may meet the cost of their education if they are lucky. 
Students face with leaving their education because of university expenditure. Even in developed countries such as Canada, Sweden, England, and the US, it is seen that some students leave their education due to the education cost (Jhonstone, Marcucci, 2010). Olssen and Peters (2005: 325) explain the impacts of new liberalism in higher education as follows: 
24 
1. Enforcing the job performance measure brought by company structure which is established on hierarchic model instead of horizontal structure of collagen and democratic administration. 2. Some of the impacts of this problem are market’s and government’s attempts of restructuring themselves and the need to meet the new demands created by this attempts, heavy workload which is a result of rising need for expertness, the problems brought about because of the imposition of the government. The professional autonomy based on traditional understanding has been eroded as a result of heavy work load in research areas and with the hierarchic structure brought by new liberal structure. New liberalism systematically restructure this area by using the gaps in the concepts of professional autonomy. 3. Market pressure increasingly outrages upon rights of traditional understanding and reshape it to adjust the market conditions. For instance, a need for an external research aid for some departments and academic units and opening summer school are being discussed. 
When the expenditures of the universities in France and England are analysed, it is seen that their expenditures are increasingly rising. Carpentier (2009: 235) states that the expenditure in 1929 Great Depression and Second World War showed a decline and the spending for university has dramatically affected by the changes in the economic structure. 
Figure 1. University spending in England and France from 1921 to 2003. Source: Carpentier 2009: 234. 
Carpentier (2009: 235) states that there are increases in university spending by years, yet spending per student shows rises and falls by periods. The governments in the UK since the mid 1980’s have adopted neo-liberal policy at least on discourse level. They defended the idea that the educational institutions should be bound to the market discipline (Turner, 2008: 97). The aims of emerging the market mechanism were to minimum the cost of education to the state budget, to make best use of sources by using less/fewer sources, and to increase the performance (Bernal, 2013: 56). It is seen that the tuition fees has risen and private financing has been increasingly preferred in higher education and spending of public sources has been decreased in England from 1970’s onward with regulation done for the higher education. 
Figure 2 shows the impacts of new liberalism in higher education in England, as it did in many other countries as well. 
Figure 2. Spending per student in England and France from 1921 to 2003. Source: Carpentier 2009: 235. 
When the revenues of the universities in England in 1970’s and onwards are analysed, it can be said that there has been a steady increase but the increase in public spending for education has lost its momentum. When the revenue structure of universities is analysed, it is seen that the revenue coming from private sources is taken from student fees and other private sources. Figure 3 shows the percentage of the university revenues. 
Figure 3. The sources of revenues in the universities in England. Source: Carpentier 2009: 238. 
Figure 3 clearly shows that the public revenues decreased in England after 1970’s and this decrease was attempted to be substituted with private revenues and tuition fees, however it failed. 
The Outcomes of Commercialization in Higher Education 
The outcomes of commercialization in higher education are analysed in literature under headings as such:rosion at Academic Standards: Universities that aim to show great performance should consider well the appointment of professors and appropriateness of the procedures. The decision making body should not only bear in mind the quality of education, research and other contributions to the academic targets of the institution. A professor should not be hired only because he may find resources from companies or he leads a profitable project. The image that universities hire professors because of financial reasons demoralize the academic staff and causes university to lose its prestige since this may give rise to the idea that the university does not pay attention to the qualified research and teaching (Bok, 2007: 106-107). 
Damages for the Academic Community: Commercialization may create tensions and separation –which do not previously exist - in the academic community by undermining trust and colleague relation in it. The academic staff who have performed great effort for traditional academic positions may feel anger for their colleagues who set up a new business or share most of their time for counselling. Academicians in Humanities may think that they are not paid the importance they deserve. Conflicts between the administration and academicians may occur because of sharing the patent revenues or a company set up by an academician but funded by the university. Postgraduate students may blame their superiors with stealing their ideas and selling them to the companies for their own profit (Bok, 2007: 112). Aksoy (2005: 5) argues that the higher education is seen as a market where international companies more easily use it; the universities are run by exterior intervention without being asked to the university administration because of the reasons such as education is began to be sold in international markets as an export product and technological products are being sold via universities; and because of the change in the higher education system led by the rising revenues of projects. 
Withdrawal or Decrease of Public Resources: This means the commercialization of the thought or pricing it by other financial resources. 
The moment when this happens, the academician is no longer has the freedom of thought and he ought to “think in accordance with the system”. He may even be expected to try finding the ways of thinking - which he is paid for - as he is ought to (Evans, 2007: 4). 
Risks for the Prestige of the University: Commercial activities may risk the prestige of the university in the eyes of the public. Public trust has decreased not only for the state but also for all the institutions including the university in the last forty years in the US universities which are committed to the truth and learning are thought to be traditionally included into this group. Besides, professors are paid less in private sector compared to most of those having a similar level of intelligence and education (Bok, 2007: 114).The Effects of New Liberalism on Turkish Economy and the Higher Education 
The decisions taken on 24th January 1980 and the three-year-standby agreement with IMF signed in June of the same year established the de-facto beginning of the new liberal transformation or adaptation process in Turkey (Sönmez, 2009: 25). Boratav (2004: 148-149) argued that the new liberal model marking the years till 1988 with the program that was outlined on 24th January and was presented to the masses with an intensive ideological campaign of which slogan was “there is no alternative” from the top on down shows all the known features of typical structural adaptation programs which were developed by the World Bank with the stabilization policy that was imposed in 1970’s by IMF to many underdeveloped countries which were under difficult financial conditions. Balseven and Önder (2009: 101) analyzed the effects of the new liberal policies in economics under two terms as 1975-1999 and 2000-2010. Real public expenditures are put under tax expenditures of the capital in the first term and are put under IMF policies section to meet the interest debts in the second term. It is possible to comment on the philosophy of the budget application under IMF section and the effect of the budget on the domestic income as such (Balseven and Önder, 2009:101): budget has been used as way of pressing to balance the inflation at one side and to meet the interest debts. It is understood that the budget seemingly is used to meet the interest debts by minimizing the public services rather than contributing the community development and domestic income. Following the military coup of 12th September 1980, as it was seen in almost every field, the higher education was reorganized by the Higher Education Act No. 2547 in 1981 and this shaped the period till now. Since 1980, universities have also undergone important financial transformations. Downsizing the state, restructuring and privatization, economic crises that were hoped to be solved with foreign credits, deeply effected various public institutions including universities (Kurul, 2006:67). 
Hatipoğlu (2001:342) argued that the university had two important losses due to the new regulations. First of these, education and training became of top priority in the new regulations and the other one is that the universities lost their autonomy, Hatipoğlu expressed. The universities, whose autonomy process began in 1919 and was interrupted in 1933, received administrative and scientific autonomy when Hasan Ali Yücel was on duty as the Minister of National Education in 1946 with 18.06.1946 dated and 4936 numbered Act. While that gain was broadened in 1960 and 1973, it was totally lost in1981 (Hatipoğlu, 2001:342). 
It can be said that the concept of circulating capital which was first used in 1947 in the Act No. 4936 was broadened after 1980 and the universities’ capacity to create financial resources was continuously increased. Changes were done in the Act related with circulating capital in the following years. It is seen that these regulations gave way to the use of the circulating capital revenues in many different areas. At the same time, a legal ground was formed to allow universities to share a 5% of its circulating capital revenues to financially support the scientific researches in the framework of Scientific Research Projects unit. It was stated in the report called “Turkish Higher Education’s Today” prepared by CoHE in 1998 that it was a necessity to radically reform the administrative and financial system in accordance with the modern applications, and it was accepted that the classical budget system consisted of many items was then the most unproductive system. It was stressed in the report that a lump sum budget system that provides bullet allotment was applied in all the universities in developed countries (YÖK, 1998: 59). Since the share of public resources was reduced in their budgets, the universities started to make their own resources and to sell the information they created to the market as a meta rather than disseminating and sharing it. Therefore, the market turned into the power that determines which courses to be given, which programs to be opened and closed, and which researches to be supported at the universities. For instance, the philosophy departments were trying to survive with their 80 students in only four out of thirty foundation universities in the higher education programs in 2007 (Özdem, 2008:117). 
It is seen that radical changes were done in budget items of the budget system with the decisions taken dealing with finance management in Turkey with the Act of Public Finance Management no. 5018 enacted in 2003. Güzelsarı (2008) analyzed this transformation in all its aspects in his book. It is observed that a structure based upon performance was aimed to set up with the Act no. 5018. In accordance with the Act, classifications of the budget were changed and new concepts were begun to be used instead. 
Karakütük (2012: 328) argued that the real reasons of this new budget coding was to allow IMF and The World Bank to monitor and direct Turkey’s monetary methods besides its other stressed aims such as to allow detecting the problems of the program, to provide functional classification, to allow measuring and analysis, to form a basis to a budget based upon performance, and to provide monetary transparency and accountability. 
The aim of this study is to analyze and comment on the financial resource allocation system, its use and finance policies, and the new liberal approaches which have been followed after 1980’s within the scope of equalitarian democratic social ideals conflict. 
Method 
Survey model is applied at this research which aims to present the allotment and use of financial resources in the higher education system in Turkey and the changes in finance policy and the reflections of these changes in the universities. For this purpose, both the analysis of numeric data of the finance of the university and the presentation of the reflections of finance policies to the university are required. Hence, this study requires two-dimensional data collection and analysis processes. One of these is the resource and document search to present the situation of the finance of higher education, and the other one is the interviews done with the university administers to present the impact of finance policies to the university. In the qualitative part of the study, it is aimed to determine the finance policies in higher education within the scope of the observation and experience of the university administers, how the allotment of financial resources and use of this resources is applied, and how this process works. Because it is required to know the application process and its outcomes in order to present the impacts of the finance policies. It may be possible – on the basis of the views of university administers - to present in detail the reflections of the finance policies to the university, different dimensions of these policies, and how the university interpret and react to the problems they face. 
In this study, geometric increase method (compound interest formula) was applied to calculate the higher education spending done by the Ministry of National Education in the years 1939 – 1940 – 1941 – 1943 – 1967 – 1969 – 1973 – 1979 since the final account budget law of aforementioned years were not reachable (Karakütük, 2012:269). The calculations were done by using the year 2005 as a base so as to analyze the change in the spending items correctly, measurably, and comparably. 2005 was chosen since it was comparably a more stable year by means of inflation and general trend in prices. Consumer Price Index of 1938 was converted to the one of 2005. For this conversion, the indexes of all years from 1938 to 2012 were divided to the index of 2005 as Consumer Price Index of 2005 were used as the base year (Karakütük 2012:391). Current expenditures and transfer spending were converted to fixed prices by using CPI (Consumer Price Index) as a base. Investment spending was converted to fixed prices by using WPI (Wholesale Price Index) as a base. WPI is given in Appendix 4. In this part of the study, the findings were gathered mostly with document analysis and calculation. Spending per student was prepared by considering the higher education spending amounts from 1986 to 2012. The number of students did not include bachelor and college students of those attending the Open Education Faculty. Evening education, master, and PhD students were included to the student numbers. 
The Population of the Study and Study Group 
The main purpose of qualitative research at determining the sample is to reach people who may provide comprehensive knowledge related with the purpose of the study. Therefore, the important thing in qualitative research is not to reach as many people as possible but to include those who may have the most comprehensive knowledge or experience. Consequently, it is needed to determine not the probability samplings but a sampling based on the purpose of the study. 
Detailed interviews have been conducted with the participation of Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Deans and Vice Deans. In this scope, the required permissions have been obtained. Only one of the permissions obtained by the universities has been presented as an example. Permission for voice recording was requested from the participants before the interviews. Only 9 (nine) out of 26 participants rejected this request, and the views of these participants was noted in written. Those whose views were noted in written were shown the notes taken and they were asked if they object to any point in these notes. It was told to the participants before the interview that their identity will be kept confidential. Having completed the interviews, recordings (by considering the sensitivity of the participants) were turned into text by the researcher’s himself. The interviews with 26 participants were 19-hour-long, and the script of these interviews covered 127 pages.

The nominal spending universities did was used by turning it into fixed price. On the other hand, logarithmic pattern was applied for serial analysis. Within this 
31 
scope, analyses were carried in accordance with Y=a bx equation as one of the data related with Y and X variables has arithmetic sequence characteristic and the other one has geometric sequence characteristic. Here, Y presents semi-log values, and X shows the years - an arithmetic sequence (Karakütük, 2012: 295). 
In this study, geometric increase method (compound interest formula) was applied to calculate the higher education spending done by the Ministry of National Education in the years 1939 – 1940 – 1941 – 1943 – 1967 – 1969 – 1973 – 1979 since the final account budget law of aforementioned years were not reachable (Karakütük, 2012:269). 
In order to reach an accurate, measurable and comparable analysis of the changes in the spending items, the calculations were carried as fixed to the year of 2005. 2005 was chosen as it was a more stable year in Turkey by means of prices and inflation. Content analysis – a qualitative data analysis - and descriptive analysis technics were applied in the analysis of the data obtained from the interview forms. 
Findings and Discussion 
Findings and Discussion of the Historical Change of University Spending in Turkey 
The spendings from 1938 to 2012 were initially evaluated with graphs in order to present the historical course of university spending in Turkey. Two different courses of time were compared so as to compare before and after 1980, these are 1938-1980 and 1981-2012. This method was also applied to compare the increase rates of the revenues of the universities. Additionally, the increase rate of the number of students and spending per student were presented as well. The graph below shows the higher education spending with current and fixed prices (2005=100) in Turkey from 1938 to 2012. Figure 4. The Historical Change of the Public Spending in Turkey for the Universities from 1938 to 2012 
When the graph comparing the higher education spending in England and France in Figure 1 which is presented by Carpenter (2009: 231-245) who was given as a reference in literature and the Figure 4 which shows the higher education spending in Turkey were compared, it can easily be told that the economic fluctuations in Turkey directly affect the higher education spending. While there was a steady increase in university spending from 1960 to 1979, there was a decrease from 1980 to 1985. This period was the time when the new liberal politics were begun to be applied as economic policy in Turkey. This graph especially shows the declines in the spending in the years such as 1994 and 2001 when the economic depressions happened. The spendings of the universities were directly affected by the economic fluctuations of those periods. This situation is similar to Carpenter’s (2009: 231-245) evaluation of England and France. Economic fluctuations have caused declines in the spendings of the universities in England and France. It is seen that the university spending in Turkey increased 8.8 % on yearly average from 1938 to 2012. Figure 5 presents the graph of this increase. 
Figure 5. The Historical Change of the University Spending in Turkey from 1938 to 2012 (2005=100) 
Figure 5 presents the higher education spending in Turkey from 1938 to 2012. The spending from 1938 to 2012 has been divided into two parts so as to compare and analyse the increase rate of higher education spending in Turkey before and after 1980. Accordingly, the increase rate of higher education spending between the periods of 1938-1980 and 1981-2012 were compared. It is recognized that the higher education spending in Turkey has increased 12.3 % on yearly average from 1938 to 1980. Table 6 presents the graph of this increase. 
Y=166.926.085.( 1,123240)43 
Figure 6. The Historical Change of the Public Universities’ Spending (TL) in Turkey from 1938 to 1980.

It is seen that the higher education spending in Turkey increased 6.2 % on yearly average from 1981 to 2012. Figure 7 presents the graph of this increase. Y=3.278.663.720 (1,062)32 
Figure 7. The Historical Change of the Public Universities Spending in Turkey from 1981 to 2012. 
When the higher education spending in Turkey is compared between the periods of 1938-1980 and 1981-2012, it is seen that the increase rate drops approximately in half in the latter period. While the increase rate of higher education spending was 12.3 % in the years 1938-1980, it decreased to 6.2 % in the period of 1981- 2012. 
When Figure 6 and 7 is compared, it is seen that the graph trend showing the higher education spending in 1938-1980 period is more upright than the graph trend of 1981-2012 period. 
Findings and Comment on the Temporal Change of University Spending in Turkey 
It is substantial to determine especially which types of spending (current, capital, transfer) showed a decline, having decided why the higher education spending’s increase rate was lower in the years 1981-2012 compared to the previous periods. In this context, the increase rate in the current, capital, transfer spending in Turkey after 1980 was calculated. 
It is seen that the current spending in higher education in Turkey increased 5.6% on yearly average from 1986 to 2012. Âdem (1977: 59) identified that the current spending in Turkey increased 11.3% on yearly average between 1960 and 1972. It is recognized that there was a correlation between the temporal change of the total higher education spending between 1938 and 1980, and there was a significant decline especially in current spending. It is seen that the investment spending in higher education in Turkey increased 7.9% on yearly average from 1986 to 2012. From 1986 to 2012, the transfer spending in higher education in Turkey increased 3.2% on yearly average. Figure 8 shows the current, investment, and transfer spending in universities in Turkey from 1986 to 2012. Significant decrease in transfer spending was recognized especially after 2005. 
Investment (capital) spending is recognized as performing relatively the highest increase by 7.9% in the higher education spending in Turkey. Yet, transfer spending was cut so as to provide this increase in investment spending and the increase in transfer spending decreased to 3.2%. Still, 5.6% increase in current spending may be seen as an evidence of economizing in order to allocate resources to the newly-established universities.

Figure 8. The temporal progress of the (1) Current, (2) Investment (Capital), (3) Transfer Spending in the Higher Education in Turkey from 1986 to 2012. 
Having presented and compared the change in the current, investment, and capital spending in the higher education in Turkey, the temporal change in the total amount of per-student spending in the higher education would give substantial clues upon the higher education policies. 
It is seen that the amount of per-student higher education spending decreased to 3.156 TL in 2012 from 4.165 TL in 1986. Similar to the findings in Carpentier’s (2009:231-245) study, it can be argued that Turkey experienced a continues decline in per-student spending from 1986 to today as England and France did. 
Figure 9. The Temporal Change in Per-Student Spending in Turkey from 1986 to 2012 
It may be said that Figure 9 clearly shows the decline in the amount of per-student spending in Turkey. It is recognized that the per-student spending in Turkey decreased 1.1% on yearly average from 1986 to 2012. It is understood that the reason of the significant increase in the per-student spending in 1988-1990 period was due to the fact that the number of students decreased in this period. 
The Historical Change of University Revenues in Turkey from 1947 to 2012 
The outlook of university revenues in Turkey from 1947 to 2012 is shown in Figure 10. presents the fixed prices of 2005 with the amounts of revenues with current prices. Figure 10. Historical Change of the University Revenues from 1947 to 2012 
An increase in universities’ own revenues especially after 1990’s is illustrated in Figure 10. Having illustrated the revenues of the universities, annual average increase rate of treasury grants and total revenue amounts have been calculated.  It is seen that universities’ own revenues in Turkey increased 9.2% from 1947 to 2012. When this is evaluated like before and after 1980 as such it is done for the comparison of the spending, it is recognized that the own revenues increased 4.2% in the period of 1947-1980 and 16% in 1981-2012 period. This is presented in Figure 10. It is seen that the amount of universities’ own revenues has increased four times in 1981-2012 period compared to 1947-1980 period. This shows that the universities – due to the scarcity of the financial sources – began to look for off-budget sources after 1980 such as circulation capital, projects, and so forth. It is seen that the treasury grants allocated to the universities increased 8.1% on yearly average in Turkey from 1947 to 2012. When the pre and after 1980 period of the treasury grants which is one of the main indicators to determine the resources of the public spending is compared, it is seen that the treasury grants allocated to the universities increased 11.3% on yearly average from 1947 to 1980. When the temporal change of the treasury grants allocated to the universities between 1980 and 2012 is analyzed, it is seen that the grants decreased 5.6% on yearly average. That is to say that the increase rate of public spending for the universities fell by half between the years of 1980-2012 compared to the 1947- 1980 period. 
It is seen that the total revenues of the universities in Turkey increased 8.2% between the years of 1947 and 2012. Figure 11 shows the temporal change of total revenues, treasury grants, and own revenues between the years of 1947 and 2012. 
Figure 11. Temporal change of (1) Total Revenues, (2) Treasury Grants, and (3) Own Revenues of the Universities in Turkey 
It is seen in Figure 11 that the inclination of the increase in own revenues is straighter than those of the total revenue and the treasury grant.

When the increase rate of research assistants from 1986 onwards is considered, it is seen that the number of research assistants increased 5.4 percent. The percentage shows that the number of hired research assistants is insufficient despite the fact that the number of students increased remarkably. Figure 12 presents the historical change of the numbers of students, instructors, and research assistants with a graph in the universities from 1986 to 2012. 
It is seen that the total number of university students annually increased 6.6% on average from 1986 to 2013. When the total number of instructors in Turkey from 1986 to today is analysed, it will be recognized that the increase rate of instructor number was left behind of the increase rate of student number. While the number of students annually increased 6.6% on average, it was 6.3% for the instructors.  (1)Y=981.842(1,066)2 8 (2)Y=56.566(1,063)28 
(3)Y=21.563(1,054)28 
Figure 12. The Historical Change of the (1) Number of Students, (2) Number of Instructors, (3) Number of Research Assistant in Turkey in the Years 1986-2013 
It can be expressed that - in Turkey as it was in the West - the source allocation, the amounts of spending, the number of instructors which is the main factor of a qualified education have failed to meet the needs that arisen because of the increase in the number of students. Especially the weak increase rate of the number of research assistants hinders the positive projections about the future of education. Âdem (1977: 147) states that the number of instructors in higher education annually increased 8.2% on average in the years 1960-1974. When it is considered that this rate was 6.3% in the years 1986-2013, it is understood that spending for staff was partly cut. The number of students in higher education annually increased 10.5% on average from 1960 to 1974 (Adem, 1977:147). When it is considered that this rate was 6.6% in the years 1986-2015, it is seen that the increase in the number of students lost its momentum. 
Findings Surfaced in the Interviews Done About the Overall Progress of the Finance of Higher Education in Turkey In accordance with one of the main aims of the study – basic changes in the finance of higher education -, important revenue sources of the universities have been determined by the answers (about the spending of the related university) of the previous administers of the universities/faculties. 
Determination Processes of the Budgets of the University and the Faculty 
It is seen that determination of the budgets of the university and the faculty depend on many factors. In accordance with the interviews, it may be suggested that the budgets of the universities and the faculties have not been determined within a pre-established system and many subjective factors play a role at determining the budget. 
It may be argued that the facts and situations stated below can be decisive at determination of the university budget: 
1. General financial situation of the country, the limitations brought by economic 
fluctuations, and inflation rates. 2. The data related with the amount of the allowance in the previous years and 
how this allowance has been spent through the years. 3. The number of total staff, student, and the size of the indoor space or campus, the fixed expenses of water, electricity, and gas directly affect the amount of sources given to the university/faculty. 4. Even though some of the university administers express that the budget is determined with the talks made with the Ministry of Finance, some interviewers claim that the budget of the university may be increased with negotiations/bargaining. These interviewers state that if university representative who will negotiate with the Ministry of Finance can be convincing for the necessity of increasing the budget, and informative about what the budget will be spent for, then the budget may be relatively increased. It is seen that the investment budget – similar to the budget – may be increased by the Ministry of Development if the necessity and importance of the investment project, the qualifications and specifications of it, and its cost are well presented. 5. How the allowance was spent in the previous years, the thoughts and the experience of the chancellors and deans about the rights/wrongs of how the allowances were spent. 6. The disposition of the Ministry of Finance to cut the share given from the capital budget to the university due to the fact that the circulation capital income has increased the revenue of the university. 7. The probability of receiving more public resource through the agency of 
bureaucratic relations and political impacts. 8. It is also expressed that the way of dean’s/faculty representative’s relation with the chancellor may affect the resource allocation. Additionally, it is stated that more resources or more equipment is allocated for certain faculties to receive more votes in chancellor election. 9. It can be said that the socio-economic situation of the location (city or region) of the university – if it is a priority region for development - may affect the amount of allocation. It is seen that the universities receive more allocation if the state intends to turn that place into a centre of attraction. Ünal (1994: 325) suggests that the structure of the societal expectations from the higher education, employment patterns and the reaction of the system to the market and motivators should be analysed in detail. Ünal, (1994: 320) stating that financing problem is directly connected with the employment and qualification in higher education, argues that, higher education has been tried to expand with political promises but insufficient resources and without considering the standards of qualification and demands of the labour market in developing countries and this situation causes problems. One of the main problems of financing the universities in Turkey is the need for a new financial formula. It is a great necessity to create an authentic formula for Turkey by considering the above-mentioned issues and the views of the university administers about it. The aforementioned new model which will be prepared with a perspective to strengthen the public education is expected to be efficient at solving the present problems of the state universities. 
The Primary Sources of Finance of the Universities 
Capital Budget and Circulation Capital 
Most of the university administers consider the capital budget as the source of income of the university. University administers stated that the source of income of the university is the capital budget because it is a state university (A12 Dean, A21 Dean, A22 Dean, A26 Chancellor). Apart from sources allocated from the capital budget, circulation capital is suggested as another source of income of the universities. In another words, “circulation capital” is regarded as the secondary source of income (the first one is capital budget) by the university administers. Nevertheless, some university or faculty administers has expressed that the circulation capital income is scarcely any and has no contribution to the overall revenue of the university (A2 Vice Chancellor, A12 Dean, A22 Dean, A7 Dean). 
The university administers consider individually the public allowance given for current expenditure and the budget decided by the Ministry of Finance as investments for the university. Should the Ministry of Finance approve the investment plan of the university, then the ministry shares a budget for it. 
The right of deciding the budget of the university by the Ministry of Finance has long been a matter of discussion among the university administers. As it is stated in the literature, in the academic meetings Prime Ministry held (1992), the university administers expressed their concerns that the decisions given for the budget of the universities by the Ministry of Finance (then named as State Planning Organization) in the 1990’s were not fair, and unusual priorities have brought about at deciding the university budgets. Today, it is seen that this phenomena/situation still continues. 
It may be suggested that the main point creating a difference at financing the higher education in Turkey is the rates of circulation capital income which changes from faculty to faculty. This situation was presented in Higher Education Strategy by CoHE in 2007. This study presents the distribution of income of the state universities in Turkey in 1995 as follows: 69% budget share, 27% circulation capital income, and 4% student fees. Though it has been fluctuating through the years, the capital income has performed a steady increase by means of its share in the revenues of the universities in Turkey. In 2005, the revenues of the universities were classified as such: 58% budget, 38% circulation capital, and 4% student fees (CoHE, 2007). 
Almost all of the interviewed university administers pay an attention to the circulation capital and put forward the idea that the circulation capital is the main factor creating a difference in the finance of the university. Especially the chancellors intend to establish Medical Faculty which is the best way to receive circulation capital, or if fail in this, they try to sign an "Affiliated Agreement” with a public hospital in the city where the university is so as to receive circulation capital. With this agreement, the members of faculty in the Medical Faculty provide health care in the public hospital in accordance with a protocol signed between the university and the public hospital, thus the university receives a proportionate amount the circulation income of the hospital. 
In the interviews, it may be suggested that three important aspects about the use of circulation income have been observed: 
First of these is, in Turkey, some universities have higher circulation income than the others do. 
Second difference is, the circulation income of same kind of faculties differ from each other’s. That is, it is observed that engineering faculties in two different universities have different amount of circulation income. 
Third difference is that the fields in Social Sciences and Fundamental Sciences are disadvantageous by means of receiving circulation capital income. It can be said that some of these faculties receive circulation income while some other receive hardly any circulation income. It may be suggested that the decisions CoHE taken may affect the possibility of the any Social Sciences Faculties’ receiving circulation income. For instance, in this respect, some Faculties of Education are allowed to open up Pedagogical Formation Certificate, while some others are not. 
It must be noted that this situation directly affects the future of the faculties and the universities because it will create developmental differences between the universities and the faculties that provide the same service. 
Projects 
It is seen that projects’ income are another important source of income for the universities. A4, A6, A8, A11, A18, A21, A22, A23, A24, A25 of the university administers expressed that they benefit well from the project income and it is a good source of income for the universities. University administers divide the project income into two categories as internal and external resources in accordance with their financial resources; and project types are addressed under two main titles. According to this division, projects are classified as substructure designs and individual projects of the members of the faculties. This classification is done to enable the university or the faculty to receive more income from project resources. Resources for substructure designs prepared by the members of faculties and faculties’ need for equipment, machinery, apparatus, and laboratory tools are provided from this source, especially, via the BAP unit of which financial resource is the circulation income of the universities and which supports the Scientific Research Projects in all universities. 
It is understood from the interviews that university’s utilizing from project resources depends on some factors or some factors are influential at universities’ receiving project resources. 
1. The amount of the circulation income that is the basic factor at supporting the scientific researches of the university is profoundly efficient. Among the administers, A8, A10, A12, A13, A15, A22 state that they are directly affected by the fluctuations in the circulation income. 2. The priorities of the institutions and organizations such as TÜBİTAK (scientific and technological research council of Turkey), Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Development and so forth which plays a significant role at distribution of the projects directly affect the level of utilization from the resources. 3. It is observed that science and engineering fields take advantage of the financial resources compared to the social fields. Among the university administers, A6, A12, A20 have stressed that they could not sufficiently utilize from the project resources. 4. It is observed that substructure designs are especially supported by the university/faculty administers because they create more resources and such projects are more easily approved compared to the individual projects which examined through a tight control. Among the university administers, A6, A11, A22, A25 notified that substructure designs receive more support and faculties utilize from these resources much more. 5. The main factors of the university/faculty related with the project are recognized as the appropriateness of substructure, laboratory, and sufficiency of the technical equipment. An administer, who stated that the project resources are not sufficiently benefited from, expressed that the laboratory is inadequate as well, and therefore, works that will bring more income are declined. This shows that the insufficiency of scientific substructure is an important aspect in this issue. 6. The ratio of academician’s free time to their workload is a basic factor at project preparation. As the academicians whose workloads are heavy could not spend enough time for the projects, universities’/faculties’ utilization level from projects is directly affected. A6, A7, A18 have told that the heavy workload profoundly decreases the time that can be spent for the projects. 7. The faculty member’s - who prepares the project - way of relation with the university or faculty administration affect his/her level of utilization from the project resources. It is seen that the projects of the members of faculty who are opponent to the present university administration may be rejected. It is recognized that the university administers’ understanding way of the laws and regulations and also their approach to the execution of the projects may affect the level of utilization from the projects resources. 8. It is observed that the history of the university (whether it is a newly established one or an old one) and the experience of the academicians at project preparation may affect the level of utilization from the project resources. One of the faculty administer (among four who stressed that they are inexperienced about project preparation) states that this is a situation that occurs because they work at a newly established university and expects that university’s this kind of income will increase in the future (A3 Vice Dean). 
Revenues Acquired from the Projects and Their Area of Use 
It is seen that the amount of the revenues of the universities acquired from the projects is directly related with the financial size and the number of the projects. How universities/faculties to be benefited from the project revenues is determined within the limits of the legal regulations. The cut rate of the university in the applied research projects and in the advisory service for the Circulating Capital Operation is determined and executed in accordance with the 04.02.2008 dated and 01697 numbered legal regulations made by the Ministry of Finance General Directorate of Public Accounts. Accordingly, the allocation is as such: 
University’s share in such advisory services is 36%. This 36% is shared as follows; 13.5% is for the university, 4.25% is for the faculty, 4.25% is for the department, 1% is for the Treasury, 5% is for SRP (Scientific Research Projects Unit), 8% is for the faculty member. 
It is possible to say that the financial support of the universities and departments for the projects may change from one university to another. For instance, a newly- founded university in Anatolia may grant up to 100K TL for infrastructure projects of the university, up to 25K TL for individual projects, and up to 30K TL for the projects to improve the quality of education-training activities. However, a university in a metropolitan city may give only up to 5K TL grant for the projects from its circulating capital (which was 10-12K in the past) due to its financial burdens and budget deficit caused because of the spending of medical faculty. Therefore, the financial resource shared for the SRP unit has shown a decline. 
57.7% of the university administers who attended the interview stated that the resources acquired from the projects are spent for machinery and equipment, 34.6% of them stated they are spent for the stationary, 30.8% of them stated that they are spent for the travelling allowances, and 11.5% of them stated that they are spent for maintenance and repair expenses. 
Donations and Aids 
7 out of 26 administrators who were interviewed within the scope of the research expressed that they may receive donation and aid. They stated that the matter of receiving donation and aid is troublesome and it is subject to strict rules. Those administrators who received donation and aid stated that donation and aid may be granted in the ways such as:  1. The donations and aids that are granted to the university by the rich and the 
benefactor who live in the city where the university is situated. 2. The donations and aids such as computer, library staff and so forth that are 
granted to the university by the Alumni Association. 3. The donations and aids that are received by the sponsors in the activities such 
as career days and graduation ceremony. 4. The donations and aids (such as painting the faculty buildings, buying tools and materials for the sport activities) that are granted by the private entrepreneurs who run the cafeteria etc. places in the university. 5. The donations and aids received by the ads on the journals, the student 
yearbooks, and so forth. 6. The donations received by the foreign governments, state institutions (Local Governing Institutions, Governorates) or private institutions (Chamber of Commerce, SME’s, Industrialists), Non-governmental Organization and the donations they grant such as old but working machines. 7. The donations and aids in kind granted by the company executives whom the member of faculties are acquainted with by way of the TÜBİTAK (Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) projects. Some faculty members, for instance, stated that they received expensive machines such as tablet maker, stability cabin and so forth. However, it was expressed that those granted machines were old but working and they were recognized in accordance with the applicable law and regulations. 
It is seen that Faculty of Sciences, Faculty of Engineering, and Faculty of Pharmacy which seek for such donations and aids are more often benefited from them. Furthermore, it can be argued that Social Sciences Faculties which are relatively deep-rooted and receive donations and aids from their alumni’s and alumni association are more likely benefited from these resources. It may be suggested that there is another significant difference between the state and foundation universities within this context. It was stressed by the university administers that the foundation universities receive a good amount of donations and aids from their foundations and founding businessmen, yet the state universities have legal and bureaucratic obstacles in the matter of establishing a foundation and the university administers may encounter with problems in case of a complaint because of establishing a foundation. 
It is thought that the benefactors and businessmen who grant donations and aids to the universities in the cities where they live consider not only contributing those universities but also realizing their future aims via these universities. That is, these donations and aids may turn into certain expectations and demands from the rector. 
It is doubtless that the amount of the above mentioned donations and aids and their impacts on the research processes may create a significant advantage for the university. It is possible to say that donations and aids can positively affect the academic staff and motivate them, and increase the number of scientific publications. However, cities (universities) do not equally receive the donations and aids. Ankara, for instance, is a place where there are relatively more industrial enterprises compared to many other cities. Yet, university administers stressed that they do not receive sufficient donations and aids when the number and financial power of the enterprises are taken into consideration. An administer from a university in Ankara stated that they could not analyze a sample due to the insufficiency of their laboratory and they declined the works that may even financially contribute the university. Here, it may be argued how and why two state universities having different conditions are subject to the same criteria in the eyes of no. 5018 Public Finance Management Law. When it is taken into consideration that a system based upon performance has been thought to put in action recently, it will be an injustice to identify these differences among universities with the scientists. 
The Policies of Resource Allocation and Resource Use and the Effects of These Policies 
By means of conceptual framework, one of the most basic indicators of the financing problem in higher education is the insufficiency of the public resources. If the state does not share sufficient resources to solve the problem, universities try to solve their financial problems by creating their own resources. 80.8% of the university administers interviewed in the scope of research expressed their concerns that the public resources does not totally meet the expenses of the university. It is stated that the biggest problems in universities are proportionately as follows: first, not having sufficient space (area), second, the inadequate number of academic staff. The interviews with administers made it clear that the inadequacy of physical space especially for the universities situated within the cities has reached its highest level. 
42% of the university administers express that they need more academic member. It has been stressed that there is a lack in the number of research assistants especially in the applied sciences such as engineering and college of science. It has been stated that the labs are mostly used by the research assistants and the place of the retired academic members’ could not adequately replaced. 
One of the issues making the academician angry is that the student quota is decided by CoHE without the approval of the academic members, yet CoHE does not allow the universities to hire adequate number of the academic staff to meet the needs arising from the rising number of students. 
53% of the university administers within the scope of the research have stated that the classrooms are not large enough. Besides, 38% of the academic members have complained that their rooms are not large enough or sometimes two-three academic members share the same room. University administers have also signified that there are problems in the universities emerging from the financial resources problem in higher education. Some of the effects of the problems in higher education caused by the new liberal politics in the country that are stated in literature are listed as follows; overcrowded classes, labs that are used unequally by the students, one out of six-seven students having an opportunity to do an experiment and the rest’s doing nothing but just watching the experiment, doing experiments only at some kinds and skipping other important kind of experiments due to financial resource insufficiency.The Differences of Resource Allocation between Social and Applied Sciences 
It can be said that the aforementioned differences of financing among the faculties are similar to the process of deciding the budget of the faculties and universities, and similar factors make a difference in this issue. The university administers’ answers in the interview show that the differences caused by the expenses such as the pressure of Medical Faculty’s expenses upon the university budget, the number of the university staff and university’s physical areas, the choices of the Chancery, applied science department’s spending such as labs, machinery, equipment, and so forth can be decisive. It has been expressed by the administers that this situation is seen not only between Social Sciences and Physical Sciences Faculties, but also between Physical Sciences and Engineering Faculties which are both applied sciences. 
Student Services 
Students come first by means of who are affected by the negative effects of the inadequacy of the public resources in higher education. In literature, it is particularly stressed that social costs are paid because of the resource cut (Jhonstone, 2008, Newfield, 2008). Newfield (2008:151) conceptualized as “Market Victims” those who suffer a loss due to social costs. By means of student services, most of the faculty administers have stressed that the deanery is not responsible from financing the student services, but the chancery organizes these services. The inadequacy of the refectory and the dormitory is initially mentioned. It is also stated that students are provided eating with reasonable prices in all universities. Yet, it is also expressed that some students do not benefit from the refectory due to the long queues in the refectory. Additionally, some faculty administers indicate that the quality of the food served in the refectory is questionable, though its price is reasonable. 
The university administers’ answers to the question concerning how they meet the financing deficit that caused because of government’s revoking student fees can be collected under such titles: 
1. Universities could not solve this problem yet. It is seen that universities/faculties struggling because of the inadequacy of the budget. The idea that this financial gap could be filled with selling real estates of the university shows the seriousness of the situation. University administers state that this financial gap will be a huge problem for the university. 2. It has been told that the universities which have a huge amount of circulation capital can fill this gap. Additionally, sufficient amount of money has been transferred from other budget items to fill this gap, or the university has begun to economize at some certain issues. 3. Some student’s facilities have been reduced because of the reduction of fees. For instance, scientific tours have been limited, the quality of meals served at refectory has been reduced, and the condition of the student dormitories has begun to go bad. 4. It has been expressed that the quality of the educational facilities has begun to 
drop. Library 
According to the interviews done with the university and faculty administers, it is seen that 80.8% of them have the idea that the data bases of the university are satisfying. 12 administers stated that the demand for the digital sources has been on the rise lately. Though the availability of the date bases is reached to a high level, only 57.7% of the university administers suggested that the libraries are sufficient. 
Financial Autonomy and Universities 
65.4% of the university administers who attended this research have stated that there is no financial autonomy in Turkey. The universities administers have stressed that the lack of financial autonomy is a key issue for universities. 
The university administers have expressed that university’s feeling of trust to it’s administers plays a key role at university spending. They state that if someone is elected as the administer of a faculty, this person should be trusted. Chart 48 has collected the administers’ ideas and thoughts related to this issue under 8 categories. 65.4% of the university administers who attended this research have stated that there is no financial autonomy of the universities. Nearly half of the university administers have expressed that there should be an easiness concerning using the resources. 19.2% of the university administers state that universities should create their own revenues and spend them for the needs of the university. 
University administers have stressed that administrative autonomy is as much important as financial autonomy. They clearly state that the academic staff to be hired and the number of students to be enrolled to the university should be decided by university’s itself. 
It can be expressed that the financial autonomy is understood by university administers as university’s creating its own revenues and have a right to spend it. 
Transformation of the Financing of the Higher Education 
The university administers who participated in this research stressed those points as the basic reasons of the transformation of the higher education: 1. The efforts to meet the financial deficit (caused by the inadequacy of the public 
resources) by creating revenues, 2. The effects of the foundation universities to the higher education system, 3. The gradually increasing popularization of the idea of doing scientific research 
based upon project, 4. The concern to follow the changes in the science and technology, 5. Global changes in the higher education, 6. The rising trend to orient to the income-generating activities with political and 
institutional motivations and pressures, 7. The spread of the idea that supports the privatization and that the private sector 
always gives better services and never loses money. 69.2% of the university administers agree with the idea that the work load has increased. This situation, as Olssen and Peters stressed (2005:325), explains that specialization has increased and thus the work load of the academic staff has increased due to the fact that new liberalism has effects of the universities as a result of the attempts to restructure the market and the state. Chart 49 shows the ideas of the administers about the transformation in the higher education and the work load. 
20 out of 26 university and faculty administers (79.9%) who participated in the research have approved the current transformation in the higher education in Turkey. University and faculty administers stated that they were supported by the higher councils in the higher education and by the rectors through scientific meetings, and by the politicians. 14 of the university and faculty administers expressed such an opinion and this is equal to 53.8% of them. 
Academic and Societal Outcomes of the Transformation of Higher Education 
University administers have been asked what they think about the academic and societal outcomes of the financial transformation of higher education. It has been found that while some administers state that this transformation have positive effects, some others have stressed that this transformation has negative effects upon public education. 
The negative effects of this process can be collected under such titles: 
1. There is an on-going negative process running against the Social Sciences and 
Fundamental Sciences concerning revenue generation. 2. The incapacity of public university at competing with the private universities 
cause a societal despair and unhappiness. 3. It is thought that making a new classification for the universities having a 
strong financial outlook may impair the universities. 4. The situation that foundation universities are not established in the place where trade is not promoted and where the population is not densely populated may have negative effects. 5. Private sector is palliative, profit-oriented, tends to save the day, and makes 
concessions from scientific norms to reduce the costs. 6. Academicians tend to deal with projects because of the project revenues rather 
than giving lectures. 7. Scientific activities conducted based on projects being unproductive 
concerning the scientific development. 8. There is a commercialisation of scientific activities and thus loss of scientific 
information. 9. Cooperation with industry may not solve all the financial resource problems of 
the universities. Therefore, universities should not lean only on industry. 10. As a result of universities getting into market, universities are considered as a financial competitor by the private companies. This causes universities’ commercial activities being limited by legal barriers. 11. Should the higher education transformation goes in this way, many 
universities in the country may not exist any longer. Results 
It can be said that the amount of resources shared for the higher education has been reduced in many countries after 1980s. It can be said that these resources have been limitedly increased in some countries by governments in accordance with price indexes after 1980s. It is seen that Turkey experienced a similar situation. Even though there was an increase in higher education spending in Turkey, it is seen that the increase in higher education spending after 1980s is comparatively lower than the one before 1980. While the annual increase rate of higher education spending was 12.3% from 1938 to 1980, it decreased to 6.2% in the years from 1980 to 2012. Although many universities have been established and there is at least one university in almost each city in Turkey, the facilities provided (which is lower than the past) for the universities is a matter of discussion. Another reality has come to surface with the classification of the public expenditure in Turkey after 1980 as current, capital, and transfer expenditures. 
When the historical change of the revenues of the universities is analysed, it is seen that the need for a cooperation with the market and the aim of earning income which are enforced by the new liberal politics accelerated in Turkey after 1980s. While the own resources of the universities was 4.2% in the 1947-1980 period, this rate increased to 16% in 1981-2012 period. This situation is consistent with the opinions of the university administers. University administers have stated that they have been encouraged and urged to do projects and they have recently carried out some projects which are seen as a primary resource to meet the financial needs of the universities. 
The position of the foundation universities in the system is one of the most serious outcomes of the new liberal politics run in Turkey. While the government does not share sufficient resources for the state universities, it, on the other hand, provides both financial resources and legal easiness for the foundation universities; and this may make the foundation universities decisive about the future of the higher education. Due to the fact that the quality of the higher education facilities run by state universities have been decreased, people may prefer the foundation universities for qualified education more than ever in the future. The present system leads the highly qualified students to go to foundation universities because of the grants given by them, and this situation is stressed by the university administers as well. This situation will decrease the feeling of trust to the public universities and limit the demand for them in the future, and this will prepare a legitimate basis for the paid education. This means that the thousands of successful but poor students will be out of the system and the democratic values and criteria in the higher education system will disappear. On one hand, the less successful but rich students’ receiving education at foundation universities and successful students’ going to the foundation universities because of the grants given to them, on the other hand, state universities’ not receiving sufficient amount of money to develop themselves reveal the double standard in higher education.

The analysis and rationale for change and development in higher education at both system and institutional level presented in this policy paper stem from a worldwide reflection exercise on the role, main trends and challenges facing higher education in which UNESCO has been engaged during the last few years. It is also part of a broader process aimed at rein forcing UNESCO's role, in its areas of competence, in the light of current and potential politi cal, social, economic and cultural developments.  11. The nature of the activities and functions of higher education and its diverse institu tional framework means that this document is addressed to a wide range of people  from indi vidual members of the academic community to all stakeholders and decision-makers, and to international organizations, including UNESCO itself. It is, however, primarily directed at the main actors responsible for the setting up and implementation of higher education policies at national and institutional level, as well as those who have an impact on international academic cooperation.  Trends in higher education  111. Recent developments in higher education are diverse and often specific to regional, national and local contexts. Over and above these differences, however, three main trends emerge which are common to higher education systems and institutions worldwide: quantita tive expansion, which is nevertheless accompanied by continuing inter-country and inter-regional inequalities in access, diversification of institutional structures, programmes and forms of studies, and financial constraints. The widening gap between the developing and developed countries with regard to the conditions of higher education and research is of parti cular concern.  Challenges for higher education in a changing world  IV. Despite progress in many areas of human endeavour, the challenges of today's world are paramount. An overview of the main global trends shows a series of concurrent, sometimes contradictory, processes of: democratization, globalization, regionalization, polarization, marginalization and fragmentation. All of these have a bearing on the deve lopment of higher education and call for adequate responses on its part. Equally important are the shifting imperatives of economic and technological development, and the modifications in development strategies, which  as UNESCO also advocates  should pursue sustainable human development in which economic growth serves social development and ensures envi ronmental sustainability. The search for solutions to the problems arising from these processes depends on education, including higher education.  Responses of higher education  a new vision  V. The responses of higher education to a changing world should be guided by three watchwords which determine its local, national and international standing and functioning: rele vance, quality and internationalization. It is also in relation to these objectives that the role and contribution UNESCO can make to facilitate the process of change and development are formulated.  7  VI. The relevance of higher education is considered primarily in terms of its role and place in society, its functions with regard to teaching, research and the resulting services, as well as in terms of its links with the world of work in a broad sense, relations with the State and public funding, and interactions with other levels and forms of education.  VII. The need for relevance has acquired new dimensions and greater urgency as modern economies demand graduates able to constantly update their knowledge, learn new skills and with the qualities to be not only successful job seekers but also job creators in conti nuously shifting labour markets. Higher education has to rethink its mission and redefine many of its functions, particularly in view of society's need for lifelong learning and training.  VIII. One of the prerequisites for the successful functioning and management of higher education resides in good relations with the State and society as a whole. These relations should be based on the principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy which are essential for the preservation of any institution of higher education as a community of free inquiry, able to perform its creative, reflective and critical functions in society. While the State may and should assume catalytic and regulatory roles, institutional self-governance in higher education should prevail. At the same time, the entire socio-economic environment compels higher education institutions to build up ties and linkages with the State and other sectors of society, and to accept that they are accountable to society in general.  IX. Limited public funding is one of the main constraints on the process of change and development in higher education. It is also a source of its current crisis and of the strained rela tions between the State and the academic community. Higher education institutions need to improve their management and to make more efficient use of the human and material resources available, thus accepting their accountability towards society.  X. Public support for higher education remains essential, but higher education institu tions need to engage in an earnest search for alternative funding sources. Moreover, all stake holders students, parents, the public and private sectors, local and national communities and authorities must join in this search. Nevertheless, the specific conditions prevailing in each country indicate that it would be erroneous to expect that alternative funding can bring higher education out of the current crisis and stop the process of deterioration now affecting many ins titutions, particularly in the developing countries.  XI. The introduction of tuition fees is a sensitive issue in higher education because it touches on many aspects of social justice and mobility, educational equity and the educational, social and fiscal policies of the State in general. It also has to be seen in the context of acade mic streaming which is in turn affected by existing tuition fees at earlier levels of the education system. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of introducing other forms of financing higher education.  XII. There is a risk that a policy of detachment of the State from higher education in mat ters of financing may result in excessive pressure for cost recovery, alternative funding and a narrow interpretation of the need for self-reliance. If higher education is to make a significant contribution to the advancement of society, the State and society at large should perceive it less as a burden on the public budget and more as a long-term national investment for enhan cing economic competitiveness, cultural development and social cohesion. This is also the fra mework within which the problem of cost-sharing in higher education needs to be addressed.  XIII. The renewal of teaching and learning in higher education is essential for enhancing its relevance and quality. It calls for the introduction of programmes which develop the intellec tual capacity of students, for improving the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary content of studies, and for the use of methods of delivery which increase the effectiveness of the higher  8  learning experience, particularly in view of the rapid advances in information and communica tion technologies.  XIV. Research is not only one of the major functions of higher education but also a pre condition for its social relevance and academic quality. The educational benefits of activities associated with research are often underestimated. These should be taken into account when decisions are made about funding academic research, especially as we are approaching a stage in development when the number of areas of common concern and joint investigation between science, technology and culture is rapidly increasing. Higher education should be seen as an indispensable partner in promoting these links.  XV. Quality has become a major concern in higher education. This is because meeting society's needs and expectations towards higher education depends ultimately on the quality of its staff, programmes and students, as well as its infrastructure and academic environment. The search for 'quality' has many facets and the principal objective of quality enhancement measures in higher education should be institutional as well as system-wide self-improvement.  XVI. The assessment and enhancement of quality should start with and actively invol ve the teaching and research staff, given their central role in the activities of higher education institutions. Human resources development policies, especially concerning recruitment and promotion, should be based on clear principles and well-defined objectives. They should stress the need for the initial and in-service training of academic staff and for more rigorous mecha nisms in the selection and training of staff for administrative and management functions in higher education.  XVII. The quality of students represents an immense problem, especially in view of mass enrolment, diversification of study programmes and current levels of higher education funding. Under these conditions, governments and higher education institutions are adopting varying solutions. There is general consensus that the quality of students in higher education depends largely on the aptitude and motivation of those leaving secondary education  hence the need to re-examine such issues as the interface between higher and secondary education, and student counselling and orientation, as well as the need to foster the notion of responsibi lity towards society among students, particularly those benefiting from public support.  XVIII. The quality of the physical and academic infrastructure of higher education is important for its teaching, research and service functions, as well as for institutional culture, which is indispensable for keeping together highly diversified and often geographically scatte red higher education institutions. Capital investment in infrastructure  from campus access roads, research laboratories and libraries to information highways  should be seen as public works forming an integral part of the overall efforts towards modernization of the economy-lin ked infrastructure.  XIX. Quality assessment is essential to the search for solutions which will enhance the quality of higher education. It is important that quality assessment should not be carried out with financial issues only in mind or be related mainly to those aspects of the overall functioning of higher education institutions which lend themselves more easily to quantitative measurement in the form of quality indicators. Due attention should be paid to the observance of the principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy. However, those principles should not be invoked in order to militate against necessary changes or as a cover for narrowly interpreted corporatist attitudes and abuse of privileges that can, in the long run, have a negative effect on the functioning of higher education.  XX. The i n t e r n a t i o n a l i z a t i o n of higher education is first of all a reflection of the universal character of learning and research. It is reinforced by the current processes of economic and political integration as well as by the growing need for intercultural understanding. The expanding9  number of students, teachers and researchers who work, live and communicate in an interna tional context attests to this trend. The considerable expansion of various types of networking and other linking arrangements among institutions, academics and students is facilitated by the steady advance of information and communication technologies.  XXI. International co-operation should be based above all on partnership and the collec tive search for quality and relevance in higher education. The deteriorating conditions in which higher education institutions function, particularly in some developing countries, require inter national solidarity. In this respect, it is important to promote those programmes and exchanges which can contribute to reducing existing imbalances and facilitating access to and transfer of knowledge.  Change and development in higher education  the role of UNESCO  XXII. The trends and challenges facing higher education and its possible responses have direct implications for the work of UNESCO. They call for:   strengthening of UNESCO's role in the development of higher education and resear ch, in its capacity as the specialized agency of the United Nations system covering these fields;   commitment of the Organization to those principles and values which should guide policies and strategies for change and development in higher education, particularly increased access, with due attention to equity;   promotion of diversity in higher education, as a prerequisite for its enhanced relevan ce and quality;   furtherance of academic freedom and institutional autonomy, as perennial values of higher education;   focusing its activities in the field of higher education on promoting international co-operation, with particular emphasis on support for the strengthening of higher edu cation and research capacity in the developing countries.  XXIII. The development of education, including higher education, through international co-operation has been a major field of action of UNESCO since its foundation. Achieving basic education for all and enhancement of opportunities for lifelong learning constitutes UNESCOís priority in the field of education. This objective goes hand in hand with the need for the renewal and advancement of education at all levels, including higher education. UNESCO will urge governments and other national and international institutions to consider higher edu cation as a social, economic and cultural investment, and to create adequate conditions for its functioning.  XXIV. UNESCO's agenda in the field of higher education will continue to favour the broa dening of availability and participation in higher education. Making higher education 'acces sible to all on the basis of individual capacity', as stipulated in the Convention against Discrimination in Education adopted by UNESCO in 1960 and reinforced by subsequent inter national covenants, remains a major concern of the Organization.  XXV. In line with the concurrent trends which agree on the need for rethinking and reform of higher education systems and institutions, UNESCO focuses its action on relevance and quality as the key features of a forward-looking higher education policy. The Organization seeks to promote diversity among higher education institutions and systems. Furthermore, UNESCO emphasizes the need to pursue efforts towards further differentiation of study programmes as the  10  means to better adapt higher education to specific national and local needs, while not losing sight of the universality of knowledge and the paramount criterion of quality.  XXVI.UNESCO will make further efforts to respond to the prerequisites for informed deci sion-making and a necessary basis for monitoring and tracking change and developments in higher education, and to assist Member States and their higher education institutions to deve lop mechanisms and methods for ensuring quality and for evaluation. In meeting this responsi bility, the Organization will continue to decentralize such activities to its Regional Offices and centres. The development of effective instruments for policy-making also require the Organization to pursue its work in the field of higher education, including the improvement of the coverage, reliability, concepts and definitions of statistics and indicators on science and higher education as well as promotion of research on higher education.  XXVII. Particular importance will be attached to promoting the principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy as basic prerequisites for academic life and the functio ning and development of higher education institutions. In view of the need to set international ly accepted standards in this respect, UNESCO will co-operate with Member States, with non-governmental higher education organizations and with the academic community as a whole in reinforcing these principles and enhancing the status of higher education teachers.  XXVIII. In accordance with UNESCO's constitutional mission, the expansion of interna tional co-operation will continue to be both its major objective and its main mode of action in the field of higher education. UNESCO's agenda is to promote co-operation worldwide while searching for more effective ways to contribute to the strengthening of higher education and research capacity in the developing countries.  XXIX. The UNITWIN/UNESCO chairs programme will continue to be the Organization's major plan of action designed to reinforce networking and other linking arrangements among higher education institutions at the interregional, regional and subregional levels. The wide range of activities covered by this programme and its flexible organizational and financing approaches have confirmed it to be suitable for the transfer of knowledge, and well adjusted to the relevant needs of the regions, countries and institutions of higher education concerned. Further development in this area will be carried out, taking into account other initiatives of UNESCO such as the UNISPAR (University-Industry-Science Partnership) programme and MOST (Management of Social Transformations).  XXX. UNESCO’s ultimate objective in this process of change and development in higher education is overall renewal and a new vision of higher learning and research embodied by the concept of a 'pro-active university' firmly anchored in local circumstances, but fully commit ted to the universal pursuit of truth and the advancement of knowledge. This should lead to the emergence of a new 'academic covenant' which would put higher education in all Member States in a better position to respond to the present and future needs of sustainable human development.  11  1. The second half of this century will go down in the history of education as a period of extraordinary expansion and qualitative trans formations in higher education, which should be understood as one of the main parts of the functionally interdependent education system. It is usually composed of a wide range of types of institution where studies and training at higher level, teaching, the conduct of research (even if its level of intensity and funding, range of fields and scholarly standing can differ bet ween particular types of institution), and ser vices to society are principal tasks and activi ties.2. This development should be seen as confirmation that we are living at a time when without good training and research at the higher level, no country can assure a degree of pro gress compatible with the needs and expecta tions of a society in which economic develop ment is carried out with due consideration for the environment and is accompanied by the building of a 'culture of peace' based on demo cracy, tolerance and mutual respect, in short  sustainable human development.  3. It is under such broad terms that higher education everywhere is being called upon to be better adjusted and more responsive to the demands of times in which new opportunities are accompanied by new challenges and uphea vals. It is now clear that higher education, like many other levels and forms of education, is being asked to re-examine, in view of its rela tions with society and particularly with the eco nomic sector, its institutional and organizatio nal setting, funding arrangements and manage ment. Higher education is being asked to deve lop, with all relevant partners, a comprehensi ve vision of its goals, tasks and functioning.  4. UNESCO considers that the relevance of its mission is greatly reinforced at the present time, in many fields within its mandate, including that of higher education and science. In the fulfilment of its constitutional functions, namely to 'maintain,  I. Introduction  increase and diffuse knowledge ... by encoura ging co-operation among the nations in all branches of intellectual activity, including the international exchange of persons active in the field of education, science and culture', UNES CO relies on higher education and the academic and research community as a major partner in action. Moreover, it regards higher education as an intrinsic component of its overall program me in its main fields of competence  educa tion, science and technology, social and human sciences, culture and communication.  5. In the context of current developments in higher education, international org a n i z a t i o n s active in this field are rethinking their policy agendas and programmes. UNESCO, in resolu tion 1.12 adopted at the twenty-seventh session of the General Conference in 1993, invited its Director-General to 'pursue the elaboration of a comprehensive policy for the Org a n i z a t i o n covering the whole field of higher education'. This policy paper is a response to that resolu tion.6. The document is the outcome of a world wide reflection exercise on the role, main trends and challenges facing higher education, under taken by UNESCO in close cooperation with national authorities in charge of higher educa tion, non-governmental organizations represen ting the academic community and those invol ved in research on higher education. In respon se to the challenges facing higher education in a rapidly changing world characterized by shif ting imperatives of economic and technological development and by new needs for social and cultural development, UNESCO launched, at the start of the 1990s, a worldwide reflection exercise on the role, main trends and challenges facing higher education. This consisted mainly of regional consultations which discussed and adopted several programmatic documents such as the Legon Statement on the Mission of the African University (Accra, 1991), the Agenda of Commitment for Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean (Caracas,13  1992), and the Sinaia Statement on Academic F reedom and University A u t o n o m y ( S i n a i a , 1992). Several studies were undertaken by the regional bureaux and centres of UNESCO. At the same time, the Secretariat of the Organization, in collaboration with the United Nations University and non-g o v e r n m e n t a l organizations in the field of higher education, initiated the elaboration of two synthesis volumes, the first, entitled The University as an Institution Today, by Alfonso Borrero Cabal, was published jointly by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC)  Ottawa and UNESCO in 1993, and a second, entitled The Role of the University: A Global Perspective, edited by Torsten Husen, in 1994 as a joint publication of the United Nations University and UNESCO.  Data and analyses included in the Statistical Yearbooks of UNESCO, the 1991 and 1993 edi tions of World Education Report, the World Science Report 1990 as well as other UNESCO studies and documents provided the factual evi dence used in the elaboration of this policy paper.  7. The meetings, publications and docu ments mentioned above have greatly contribu ted to building a shared platform of ideas and a conceptual framework for development and change which is reflected in the vision of higher education presented in this policy paper. Its ela boration should also be seen as part of a broa der process aimed at reinforcing UNESCO's role in the light of the profound political, social, economic and cultural developments currently taking place. Special mention should be made of the forthcoming reports by the International Commission on Culture and Development and the International Commission on Education for the Twenty-First Century, which was set up by UNESCO under the chairmanship of Jacques Delors, President of the Commission of the European Communities. Its reflection on the new role and demands of education also covers the challenges facing higher education in the context of other levels and forms of education.  8. The nature of the problems facing higher education is such that comprehensive, s y s t e m-wide as well as institutional-l e v e l reform is needed. Consequently, any attempt to formulate a policy framework must draw on a wide variety of view-points. Several agencies of the United  Nations system have been involved in the cur rent debate on higher education. Other inter governmental organizations have undertaken a similar exercise in the context of their own pro grammes and agendas. Their experience has been of great assistance.  9. The paper begins with a brief analysis of what IJNESCO considers the main trends in higher education and which can serve as a basis for the formulation of the Organization's policy. These trends are drawn from diverse national experiences worldwide and from the views expressed by Member States, intergovernmen tal and non-governmental organizations, higher education authorities, decision-makers and researchers. The main challenges facing higher education in a rapidly changing world may be grouped under three main headings:   re l e v a n c e, meaning the role and place of higher education in society and there f o r e covering its mission and functions, pro grammes, content and delivery systems, as well as equity, accountability and financing issues, while emphasizing academic free dom and institutional autonomy as the prin ciples underlying all efforts to assure and enhance relevance;   q u a l i t y, defined as a multidimensional concept embracing all main functions and activities in higher education;   i n t e r n a t i o n a l i z a t i o n, the inherent charac teristic of higher education which has been considerably enhanced throughout the latter half of this century.  10. One of the principal features of the paper is an examination of how higher education can respondto these challenges, both at system and institutional levels, and on the contribu tion that UNESCO can make to supporting Member States and their higher education insti tutions in developing their own policies and in facilitating the process of change and develop ment.  11. The comprehensive character and struc ture of this policy paper means that it is addres sed to a broad spectrum of people. They range from individual members of the academic com munity to stakeholders and decision-makers in higher education and international organiza tions, including UNESCO, in view of its role as the specialized United Nations agency in this field.  14  II.

However, when interpreting these trends, show substantial differences from one region or country to another. This overall trend is due to several factors: demographic growth, signifi cant advances in the provision of primary and secondary education which have meant that more young people are eligible to seek admis sion to higher education; the economic growth experienced by many countries and regions,  15 it is necessary to bear in mind the very low star ting base of higher education in the developing countries and the high rate of population grow th there. It must also be recalled that the youn ger population has been growing continuously in the developing countries while most develo ped countries have experienced an increase in their older population. and awareness that this development correlates well with investment in higher education. Another major reason is the emergence of inde pendent and democratic countries which have seen in higher education a key instrument not only for their future economic development but also for the social, cultural and political change required to remove the vestiges and inheritance of colonialism and other undemocratic systems, to foster national identity and to develop local human resources and capacities to receive  16. To put enrolment increases into perspec tive it is necessary to relate them to the corres ponding school-age population. This ratio, expressed as a percentage, gives an idea of the capacity of access to a given level of education. Enrolment ratios of the 18 to 23 age-group indi cate considerable inequalities among the princi pal world regions. The figures confirm a fairly steady growth overall  from 9.6 per cent in 1960 to 14.8 per cent in 1970 and 18.8 per cent in 1980, followed and apply knowledge and technology.  by a slight decrease to 18.6per  cent in 1990, rising again to 18.8 per cent in 1991. Over the same period, the enrolment ratio in the developed countries showed a steadier increase and at a much higher level  15.1 per cent in 1969, 27.1 per cent in 1970, 30.7 per cent in 1980 and 40.2per cent in 1991. The cor responding ratios for the developing countries were: 7.3 per cent in 1960, 10.1 per cent in 1970, 15.1 per cent in 1980 and 14.1 per cent in 1991.  17. This inequality of access becomes parti cularly obvious when considered in terms of the number of students per 100,000inhabitants, which is a revealing indicator of the overall level of development of higher education in a given country or region. In 1991, this number varied from over 5,000 students in North America to more than 2,500 in practically all the developed countries. Only a few developing countries have a ratio within this range and the vast majority have far fewer students. Particularly worrying is the situation in sub-Saharan Africa, where the ratio is less than 100 students per 100,000 inhabitants. T h i s means that young people's opportunities to pur sue higher education in the region are 17 times lower than in the industrially developed coun tries (on average, they are four times lower for young people in all the developing countries). As underlined in UNESCO's World Education Report 1993, the 'higher education gap' bet ween the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world is one of the most striking disparities in education today.  18. It is also significant that the expansion of student enrolment has been concentrated in study programmes involving lower spending on personnel, equipment and overall functioning than in more resource-demanding fields of study such as the natural sciences and technolo gy. While the overall growth in student enrol ment has also meant broader access of under-represented categories such as women, ethnic minorities and students from low-income families or rural areas, greater equity in access to higher education must remain an objective of any forward-looking policy.  19. Trends concerning women's partici pation in higher education attest to what can be achieved when adequate policies are adop ted. UNESCO's statistics show that the percen tage of women in the total student population in higher education increased from 34 per cent in  1960 to 43 per cent in 1980 and 45 per cent in 1991 (it is estimated that it will stay at about 44 per cent until the year 2025). Although appre ciable progress has been made, there are still noticeable differences between the major regions of the world. In 1991 the percentage of women students was 27 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa, 33 per cent in East Asia, 36 per cent in South Asia and 37 per cent in the Arab States. Concern has also been expressed that female enrolment is often concentrated in certain clus ters of fields of study such as medical care and teaching, while women are under-represented in science and technology and in postgraduate studies that lead to an academic career.  20. UNESCO's projections for enrolment in higher education show an increase in the num ber of students worldwide from 65 million in 1991 to 79 million in the year 2000, 97 million in 2015 and 10() million by 2025. The need to develop mass quality higher education will represent a major challenge in the years to come. Projected enrolments in the developing countries also show a strong increase: from 30 million students in 1991 to 40 million in the year 2000, 50 million in 2015 and 54 million in 2025. However, in view of the projected popu lation growth over the same period, the inequa lity in opportunities for higher education will persist: while participation in higher education should cover about half of the eligible popula tion in the developed countries, less than 10 per cent of the population will be enrolled in higher education in the developing countries.  Diversification of structures and forms  21. Profound changes in the institutional structures and forms of higher education as well as methods of teaching, training and learning have been or are being undertaken by national authorities and by the institutions themselves. One of the direct results has been the diversifi cation of higher education in practically all world regions. Although universities in particu lar, which cherish their long-established tradi tions, are somewhat resistant to change, higher education as a whole has undergone a far-rea ching transformation in a relatively short period of time.  22. The reasons for these changes are both external and internal. Among the external fac tors, the following have been particularly rele vant for the process of diversification:  16   increased social demand for higher educa tion and the need to cater for a much more diversified clientele;   drastic cuts in spending on public higher education, thus compelling institutions to design alternative, more cost-effective pro grammes and delivery systems;   constantly changing labour market needs which have required higher education insti tutions to make provision for training in new professional, technological and managerial fields and in new contexts, as a result of the globalization and regionalization of econo mies.  23. The following three internal factors have been pertinent, particularly for the reorga nization of teaching and research activities in higher education:   enormous advances in science, resulting in the development of academic disciplines and their further diversification;   growing awareness of the need to promote interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches and methods in teaching, trai ning and research;   rapid development of new information and communication technologies and their gro wing applicability to various functions and needs in higher education.  24. The cumulative outcome of the pro cesses outlined above is a pronounced diversity within the national systems of higher education, mainly concerning institutional structures, pro grammes, student population and funding sources. The internal complexity of national systems is such that hardly any taxonomy, however flexible, can make a clear-cut distinc tion between various types of institution and programme. There is, nevertheless , a certain degree of similarity in the way the individual institutions see their place in the higher educa tion system. The identification and analysis of some particularly distinctive traits are a rele vant indicator of past changes, and can also signal the likely direction of development.  25. The following dichotomous, but not necessarily bipolar, differentiations within many higher education systems have been observed during recent years concerning:   University and non-university types of higher education institution. Even if there are noticeable variations among universities themselves concerning the amount and qua lity of research, the number of academic dis ciplines and study programmes and so on, they are nevertheless significantly different from non-university higher education insti tutions.   Size. Higher education institutions range from small to medium-sized and large insti tutions with corresponding differences in the number of students and staff. Large institu tions are frequently located in urban centres where they may be major employers. When higher education institutions function in several localities, they are often multi campus organizations accommodating various affiliated colleges and institutes as well as postgraduate or professional schools. Some function as 'federated' or 'comprehen sive' universities.   Academic profile and level of study. Certain institutions have a disciplinary spe cialization such as agriculture, medicine, teacher training, social sciences or physical education, but the current trend is towards a more comprehensive disciplinary context. Closely linked to this trend is diversification of levels of study. The programmes usually classified as undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate and which lead to one of the three main types of degree  bachelor, mas ter and doctor (or their national and profes sional equivalents), are the main forms of certification in higher education. However, many functions associated with higher stu dies and training are now taking place in environments other than traditional higher education institutions. These programmes often respond to the specific learning needs of a highly diverse clientele for example by providing distance learning courses  and answer the demands of further professionali zation and the constantly changing labour market. Their certification raises problems of both an academic and professional nature, including the need to grant academic reco gnition to skills acquired outside academic institutions.   The student body. For economic and social  reasons, the number of part-time,  17  n o n-d e g r e e-course students is increasing. Furthermore, even full-time students are ten ding more often to begin studies after some work experience or to alternate periods of work with periods of study. Consequently, the traditional age structure of the student body is becoming more diversified.   Funding sourc e s and proprietary status. Higher education institutions fall into three major categories: public, private and mixed. The proportion of students in private institu tions is on the increase, reaching over 50 per cent of total enrolments in some countries, mostly developing ones. The recent emer gence of private higher education institu tions and professional schools, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, meant that laws had to be passed to cope with this new sec tor. It is generally agreed that, at least from the point of view of academic standing, the differences between private higher educa tion institutions are greater than those within the public sector. It should also be pointed out that there can be substantial differences even within a given national system concer ning the legal status and academic accounta bility of different private higher education institutions.  26. Other types of differentiation can be dis cerned in higher education, although they are less relevant to the ongoing diversification pro cess. Thus, in certain national systems a dis tinction can be observed between institutions which, by their character and location, have a national mission and those which cater for the needs of a particular region or even locality. On the other hand, certain institutions, particularly professional schools, are international in cha racter. There are also regional institutions ser ving the needs of several small States, particu larly island States, which lack the economies of scale that would enable them to establish fully fledged institutions of their own. Other institu tional distinctions can be made between secular and religious institutions and although this is increasingly uncommon  between gender spe cific institutions.  27. It would be erroneous to present any of tl1e types of institution and programme described above as optimum responses or models. It might be tempting, for instance, to postulate that if  wider access to and provision of higher educa tion at a lower cost were the desired goals, then differentiated institutions, preferably distance e d u c a t i o n-based and predominantly private, would be the solution. However, one should not lose sight of the fact that a decision taken about one component, function, mission or structure in a higher education system does not leave the others unaffected. Diversification is a most wel come trend in higher education today which should be supported by all the means available. But underlying all decisions geared towards promoting diversification must be concern to ensure the q u a l i t y of institutions and pro grammes, equity with regard to access and the preservation of higher education's mission and function, with full respect for academic free dom and institutional autonomy.  Constraints on funding and resources  28. The correlation between investment in higher education and the level of social, econo mic and cultural development is well establi shed. There is, therefore, concern about the continued demand for quantitative expansion in higher education within the existing pattern and level of its financing. In the majority of cases, the growth in the number of higher education students has not been accompanied by increases in the allocation of resources in real terms, thus obliging many institutions to make cutbacks in their budgets, study programmes, moderniza tion of infrastructure, library holdings, interna tional co-operation and even academic staff. Shortage of funds combined with growing public awareness of how these are allocated has often brought about a reduction of State fun ding for higher education, in both developed and developing countries. Funding constraints have affected all types of higher education ins titution, even the best endowed.  29. Meeting rising social expectations about higher education when resources are dimini shing presents major difficulties for the develo ping countries, particularly where fiscal constraints deriving from the need to control public budgets have been further affected by the consequences of structural adjustment poli cies. According to UNESCO's statistics, deve loping countries spend a much higher propor tion of their GNP on the public higher education sector. But even when  18  relatively high priority is given to higher edu cation, these countries are still far from able to allocate the level of support they need or that can be found in the developed regions of the world. On average expenditure per student in absolute terms is ten times lower in the develo ping countries than in the industrialized world. Such problems reveal a policy dilemma with regard to public spending on higher education: the poorer the region, the higher the relative cost per student, estimated in terms of the per centage of GNP allocated to higher education.  30. Hardly any country can nowadays sup port a comprehensive system of higher educa tion from the public purse alone. Moreover, given the state of the economy in a number of regions and persistent State and local budget deficits, it seems unlikely that this trend will be reversed in the coming years. The call to seek alternative sources of funding is part of the cur rent 'policy landscape' in higher education. As a consequence, there is enormous pressure for a modified distribution of cost-sharing respon s i b i l i t i e s, through the introduction and/or increase of tuition fees and other study-related charges, and through the encouragement of various income-generating activities such as contract research, a broad range of academic and cultural services and short-term courses. The search for alternative funding has proved much more difficult for the developing coun tries.  Enhanced internationalization  31. Recent developments in education and science have reinforced the validity of the argu ment that since knowledge is universal, its pur suit, advancement and dissemination can be greatly enhanced by the collective efforts of the international academic community. This is the reason for the ingrained international dimen sion of academic life in general, encompassing higher education institutions, scientific socie ties and student associations. The particular attention paid to the internationalization of the content and context of higher education func tions and the growth of student and staff mobi lity gain additional significance in the light of current trends in global trade, economic and political integration and the growing need for intercultural understanding. The expanding number of students, teachers and researchers who study,  work, live and communicate in an international context, a phenomenon facilitated by new tele communications technologies, affirms this ove rall positive development.  32. According to UNESCO statistics, the number of people pursuing higher education studies outside their country of origin increased by almost 30 per cent over the last decade: from about 920,000 in 1980 to about 1.2 million in 1990. Most of these (more than 750,000 in 1990) came from the developing countries. However, the same statistics indicate that the overall increase in the number of students pur suing studies abroad is not keeping up wit the absolute growth of higher education enrolment worldwide. Therefore, in percentage terms, stu dent enrolments in higher education are tending to become less 'international' in character. This is not necessarily a matter for concern since it could be an indication of the increasing capaci ty of the developing countries to train their own students at home. But it is also important to consider these developments in the context of emerging patterns, forms and directions of stu dent and academic staff mobility.  33. Much student mobility takes place outsi de the framework of any structured or organi zed exchange programme. Many countries and institutions regard higher education as a signifi cant 'export segment' of their services and a source of additional income, particularly since most foreign students pay the full cost of their tuition. The major beneficiaries are the higher education institutions in the developed world, even if in some cases, mainly at the advanced level, the host countries and their institutions share the cost of studies. The overall conse quences of this trend are already reflected in the composition of the international student body, with the number of students from developed countries increasing faster than the number from developing countries. Moreover, some 97 per cent of students from the developed coun tries who undertake studies abroad go to ano ther developed country, so that student mobility is becoming more North-North and less South-North. In other words, while the benefits of study abroad are increasingly recognized, the costs involved make it a privilege for those countries (or students) that can a fford it. Proof of this is the fact that among foreign students from the developing countries, numbers are declining everywhere except in Eastern Asia and Oceania19  regions where several countries have made significant economic progress in recent years.  34. The risks of external brain drain have for some years been a major dilemma for interna tional co-operation in higher education, particu larly in its more traditional -forms where exten sive absence from the home country or acade mic institution is the norm. The overall adverse effects of the brain drain on developing coun tries are well known and in most eases are not counterbalanced by the financial remittances sent back by those employed abroad or by other beneficial side-effects. According to the 1992 Buman Development Report of the United Nations Development Programme, nearly one third of Africa's highly skilled personnel had moved, mainly to European countries, by 1987 and up to 60,000 middle and high-level mana gers and other categories of personnel moved between 1985 and 1990. The external brain drain has also affected other regions. The scale of the loss of this human capital from the developing to the developed world is to some extent related to the  fact that the latter countries take account of the formal level of educational and professional credentials in their immigration policies.  35. The problem of long-term external brain drain is linked to student and academic mobili ty, but it is not entirely and exclusively caused by it. It is part of a much wider phenomenon of regional and international migration resulting from interrelated economic, social and political factors. It is also indicative of the strained state of economic, social and political affairs in many parts of the world. Study abroad can be considered as one of the contributory factors to the migration of highly qualified human capital and talent. However, a large number of those involved in the brain drain phenomenon have in fact been educated in their own countries. The lack of local incentives and opportunities for the professional advancement of young resear chers and graduates can become a prevalent factor conducive to external and internal brain drainboth being detrimental to the functioning and long-term development of higher educa tion.  20  III. Challenges for higher education in a changing world  Outlook on major challenges   Democratization, which can be seen in the  36.

Regionalization, in which States form grou pings to facilitate trade and economic inte gration as a means of reinforcing their com petitiveness. Regional arrangements may also be useful in matters of education, cultu re, environment, labour markets and infra structures .  37. Despite enormous progress in many areas of human endeavour, today's world is beset with tremendous problems and chal lenges, dominated by the demographic changes due to strong population growth in some parts of the world, frequent outbreaks of conflict and ethnic strife, hunger, disease, persistent poverty, homelessness, long-term unemployment and   Polarization, which is evident in increased inequalities on a global, regional and natio nal scale and results in a widening gap bet ween rich and poor countries and popula tions, with the whole array of political, eco nomic and social consequences this process entails.  ignorance, and by problems related to protec tion of the environment, securing peace, demo cracy, respect for human rights and the preser vation of cultural diversity.

Current international trends are  lopment on a new course has also prompted the characterized by a series of concurrent, some  United Nations and its Specialized Agencies, times contradictory, processes:  programmes and funds to search for new approaches. This line of action has been reflec ted in the agendas, debates and decisions of various international fora held under the aus pices of the United Nations. Among those which have been considered in this policy paper are:   the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (June 1992, Rio de Janeiro) which adopted Agenda 21 as a blueprint for action for global sustainable development into the next century;   Agenda for Peace, which sets out the objec tives, principles and possible measures to be taken up in order to ensure peace and securi ty, adopted by the United Nations in 1992;   the World Conference on Human Rights (June 1993, Vienna), the decisions of which reinforced the view that development is a universal right and an integral part of human rights;   the International Conference on Population and Development (September 1994, Cairo), which pointed to the corner-stone role played by education in coping with the popu lation factor in the current and future deve lopment agenda.  40. The common denominator of the views set out in these documents is the strong recom mendation for concerted action by all concer ned  States and governments, inter governmental organizations, business and pro fessional communities, non-g o v e r n m e n t a l organizations, the media and the public at large in order to shape the policies, attitudes and modes of action of the community towards sus tainable human development. There are clear indications that this process will gain further momentum in the context of the Agenda for Development being prepared by the United Nations and in the wake of such major interna tional events as the World Summit for Social Development (Copenhagen, 1995) and the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995).  41. There is unanimous agreement, fully endorsed at numerous international fora and in major policy-setting documents, that the sine qua non condition for humankind to cope with the challenges it is facing at present resides in human resource development, understood not in its narrow managerial meaning, but in a broa  der sense in which education and training play a major role. Access to higher education and to the broad range of services it can render to society is part and parcel of any sustainable development programme in which high-level human expertise and professional skills are required.  Shifting imperatives of economic and technological development  42. One of the critical economic challenges facing many countries, including the most industrialized, is how to enhance their ability to adapt to changes in the economy, technolo gy and international trade. The pace and depth of those changes are unprecedented and affect many domains of human activity. They create new opportunities but also pose numerous pro blems, particularly with regard to the world of work Developments in this domain go beyond the usual ups and downs of economic fluctua tions. It is also increasingly understood that the impact of economic and technological change is such that if not dealt with in time and in an adequate manner, it can unravel a whole set of social and political problems with inevitable local, national, regional and international consequences. Much is expected of education and training in order to cope with these shifting imperatives.  43. The impact of technological develop ment, particularly in information and communi cations, is such that all countries, regardless of their level of industrial development, have to use globally accepted standards and equipment. This applies not only to 'hardware', but also to organizational structures and the human factor  'humanware'. This is dependent on or related to education, particularly at the vocational and higher levels.  44. The consequences of the above develop ments are particularly relevant for higher edu cation, since it is this level which, in co-opera tion with vocational and technical education, is engaged in the development of a quality work-force on which depends the creation of quality jobs.  New development strategies and higher education  45. The search for solutions to the challenges outlined above has to be seen in the context of  22  national and local cultural and social values. These solutions must also be in harmony with the principles on which societies wish to base their international social, economic and cultural relations. Whatever the conclusion, links with society as a whole are essential in the concept of the higher education institution and its natu re as a place of encounter for those motivated by a passion for learning and committed to sha ring existing knowledge and searching for new knowledge.  46. Research into modern social and econo mic development shows that it cannot flourish inside rigid or imposed structures. The failure of development strategies based on the rigid transmission or imposition of economic models is one lesson drawn from practical experience, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Central and Eastern Europe. This conclusion also applies to the problems facing higher education. One of the main findings of the UNESCO consultations organized in prepa ration for this policy paper was that more and more people and institutions have become aware that, in all regions, the rigid adoption of foreign concepts and values and the neglect of regional and national cultures and philosophies have had negative repercussions on education. This finding should be borne in mind by States undertaking higher education reforms.  47. The basic premises of the concept of indigenous and sustainable development were formulated in 1991 by the United Nations in its International Strategy for Development, which was subse quently approved by the General Assembly. It considers that economic development  should be based on two main foundations: the reduction of poverty and the development of human resources. Higher education has beco me, more than ever, an important partner for all concerned with these problems. Human deve lopment and the building of more co-operative and participatory relations in society are direct ly related to the effective use and development of existing educational opportunities, including at higher education level.  48. From the above brief analysis of chal lenges for social, economic and cultural deve lopment in a rapidly changing world it becomes clear that:   Higher education stands out as one of the keys to setting in motion those broader pro cesses which are necessary to cope with the challenges of the modern world.   Higher education and other academic, scien tific and professional institutions and organi zations, through their functions in teaching, training, research and services, represent a necessary factor in development and in the implementation of development strategies and policies.   A new vision of higher education is needed which combines the demands for universali ty of higher learning with the imperative for greater relevance, in order to respond to the expectations of the society in which it func tions. This vision stresses the principles of academic freedom and institutional autono my while at the same time emphasizing the need for accountability to society.  23  IV.

Two parallel trends determine the rela tionship between higher education and the world of work. Firstly, higher education is moving towards a mass enrolment system as society accords to higher education.  modern economies become increasingly know The aim should be to make higher  ledge intensive and therefore depend more on education more responsive to the general  graduates of higher education, who constitute problems facing humanity and the needs  a 'thinking work-force'. Secondly, of economic and cultural life, and more rele vant in the context of the specific problems o f a given region, country or community.  graduates will have to accept the need to keep changing jobs, update their knowledge and learn new skills. The world of  work is being radically redefined and a large part of the specific knowledge that students acquire during their initial training will rapidly become obsolete. Continuous and interactive partnerships with the productive sector are essential and must be integrated into the overall mission and activities of higher education insti tutions. But it should be emphasized that higher education has to view its relations with the world of work from a long-term perspective and in broad terms.  54. Although higher education institutions are not the only ones in modern society provi ding professional training of highly qualified personnel, this nevertheless remains one of their major responsibilities. Universities and other higher education institutions are still considered a particularly appropriate place for the overall training of those leaving secondary education in many academic disciplines and on which further professional training can be based. They also provide an appropriate setting for young people to develop skills essential for e ffective collaboration between individuals with varied professional and cultural back grounds. This traditional function has to be seen in the context of the growing need for 'educa tional services', as society moves towards a model of lifelong learning for all, which is gradually replacing the prevailing model of selective and concentrated learning and study for a limited period. Only a sufficiently diversi fied and flexible system of access to and provi sion of higher education can meet the chal lenges of a rapidly changing labour market.  55. New conditions in the world of work have a direct influence on the aims of teaching and training in higher education. Merely increa sing curriculum content and students' w o r k-load cannot be a viable solution. Preference should therefore be given to subjects which develop students' intellectual capacity and allow them to deal judiciously with techno logical, economic and cultural change and diversity, equip them with qualities such as ini tiative, an entrepreneurial attitude and adaptabi lity, and allow them to function with greater confidence in a modern work environment.  56. With this in mind, higher education must develop both responsive and pro-active atti tudes towards tl1e labour market and the e m e rgence of new areas and forms of employment. It needs to pay attention to changes in major market trends so  as to adapt curricula and the organization of stu dies to shifting circumstances and thus ensure greater chances of employment for graduates. More importantly, however, higher education must contribute to shaping the labour markets of the future, both by performing its traditional functions and by helping to identify new local and regional needs conducive to sustainable human development. Put succinctly, at the times when the equation 'degree = job' no lon ger applies, higher education is expected to pro duce graduates who can be not only job seekers but also successful e n t re p re n e u r s and j o b creators.  57. In response to these challenges, the acti ve involvement of the academic community with economic partners is increasingly percei ved as an integral part of the mission of higher education. These relations still mainly concern research which can contribute to technological development, but there is a growing understan ding of the need to expand them to such areas as teaching, training, organization of study and institutional structures. At the same time, new arrangements based on flexibility in program me delivery are being sought to serve as viable mechanisms for the promotion, maintenance and strengthening of stable and mutually bene ficial interactions.  58. As organizations in the private and public sectors are increasingly exposed to the effects of worldwide economic and political change, employees who can work efficiently in such settings also require an international context for training, retraining and refresher courses. Higher education institutions, as orga nizations encompassing many cultures and par ticipating in a wide spectrum of international activities, are well suited to providing a suffi ciently dynamic studying and teaching environ ment with a pronounced international dimen sion and a global perspective.  59. The process of globalization provides additional evidence that modern development of human resources implies not only a need for expertise in advanced professionalism but also full awareness of the cultural, environmental and social issues involved. It has become important for higher education institutions to reinforce their role in enhancing ethical and moral values in society and to focus attention on developing an active, participatory civic spirit among25  future graduates. Greater emphasis is also nee ded on the student's personal development alongside preparation for professional life. The demand for such graduates and study pro grammes could represent an opportunity for the revitalization of humanities and the arts in higher education and open up new opportuni ties for co-operative links with various econo mic and public organizations.  Relations with the State and the basis for institutional governance and management  60. Establishing well-o rganized relations between higher education and the State is a pre requisite for the process of change and deve lopment in higher education. It is mainly a res ponsibility of the State and its institutions to define the overall regulations and broad finan cial framework in which higher education insti tutions carry out their mission. Essential in this regard is the legislative function of the State, particularly in view of the institutional, proprie tary and functional diversification of higher education.  61. A clear grasp of the principles on which relations between higher education and the State are based is a pre-condition for quality and accountability in governance and manage ment of higher education institutions. Academic freedom, understood as a set of individual and collective rights and responsibi lities, is central in this respect. Together with the recognition of institutional autonomy, it is essential for the preservation of the university or any other higher education institution as a community of free inquiry. It is these principles which, in many respects, make higher educa tion institutions different from educational ins titutions at other levels and from research orga nizations. This should not be interpreted as an imposition of external models and principles but as a general prerequisite for progress in the dissemination of knowledge and the services higher education can offer to a given communi ty and to society as a whole.  62. Recent history has provided strong evi dence of the need to defend the principle of aca demic freedom as a sine qua non for the exis tence and normal functioning of higher educa tion institutions. The proper degree of statutory institutional autonomy should therefore  be granted to both public and accredited pri vate higher education institutions to allow them to be relevant and perform their creative, reflective and critical functions in society. While the State may ensure general co-ordina tion in various system-wide policy matters such as accreditation and quality assessment, institu tional self-governance should be given adequa te, pragmatic form. At the same time, the entire s o c i o-economic environment is compelling higher education institutions to build up ties and partnerships with the State and other sec tors of society and to accept that they are accountable to society.  63. However the principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy should not be used as a cover for professional negligence and/or organizational incompetence. they should imply increased responsibility in acade mic work, including its ethical context, and in matters of funding, self-evaluation of research and teaching, and a constant concern for cost-effectiveness and efficiency. On the other hand, evaluation and quality assessment, parti cularly of public higher education institutions, should not be made synonymous with external over-regulation or used as a way of restricting public funding. They should function as mecha nisms allowing higher education to secure its self-improvement. In this complex policy envi ronment, both the State and higher education institutions should recognize the positive role played by 'buffer organizations' and other insti tutional forms of collective representation.  64. Analyses of the present conditions of higher education are unanimous in pointing to insufficient financial resources as one of the main constraints on its further development. The challenge of limited resources is unlikely to be overcome in the near future, so higher education institutions will have to find ways of coping with this challenge. Elimination of weaknesses in governance and management is paramount in this process. Therefore it is in the interest of public and private higher education that it should consider the issues of evaluation and quality, including institutional and pro gramme accreditation, as vital for a responsive and accountable system of governance and management.  65. The most viable institutions of higher education, in-both financial and operational terms,  26  are those which have succeeded in incorpora ting mechanisms and information systems that enable them to remove mediocrity and guaran tee quality of teaching, research and service. These are also the institutions which stand a better chance in competition to obtain resources from the public and private sectors.  66. A key to improved governance and management is confidence in the leadership and managerial qualifications of those involved in these activities. This implies improvements in selection and assessment as well as the enhan cement of appropriate training and develop ment provisions at the system, institutional and department levels. It also implies further pro motion of research on higher education which should be regarded as an important 'knowledge base' for policy making.  Funding and cost-sharing responsibilities  67. The major problem facing almost all developed and certainly all developing coun tries is the basic dilemma that arises from conti nued high social and individual demand for access to various forms of studies and educatio nal services at a time of growing constraints on public budgets. This situation is nowadays a principal source of strained relations between the State on the one hand and higher education institutions and the academic community on the other. Higher education has to show that it can compete with other organized interests for financial attention from public funding sources. However, the existing and projected difficulties of public budgets should not be the sole context in which the financing of higher education is discussed; it is also timely to discuss these pro blems from the point of view of shifting the burden for expansion of higher education from public to private sources.  68. Under existing economic conditions, ins titutions of higher education sometimes have recourse to selective 'cost recovery' regarding their service activities. The adoption of such measures should be accompanied by an earnest search for ways of making more efficient use of their own human and material resources. The introduction of tuition fees, for instance, is a sensitive issue in higher education and should, accordingly, be approached with due caution since it touches on many aspects of social justi  ce and mobility, educational equity and the edu cational, social and fiscal policies of the State in general. It also has to be seen in the context of academic streaming, which is affected by exis ting tuition fees at the preceding levels of the education system because of its external and internal implications for the student body, governance and public standing. Above all, due attention should be paid to accompanying fees with adequate provision of support for needy students in the form of grants and loans.  69. There is a risk that a radically applied policy of detachment of the State from higher education in matters of funding, influenced by a narrowly interpreted concept of the 'social value' of a given level of education, may result in excessive pressure for 'cost recovery' and calls for 'alternative funding' and 'internal effi ciency gains' in teaching, research and adminis tration. Another danger is an excessive demand to 'commercialize' the activities carried out by higher education institutions. In this case obser vance of standards concerning student admis sion, study programmes, graduation and tea ching may become a matter of general concern and a source of tension between higher educa tion establishments, the State and the public at large. Efforts should therefore be made, through appropriate monitoring and accreditation proce dures, to reduce these tensions since all genui ne higher education establishments, regardless of their form of 'ownership', are called upon to perform mainly public functions.  70. The main criterion for evaluating the functioning of higher education is the quality of teaching, training, research and service to the community. Therefore, it is important not to confuse the liberalization of economic relations and the need to promote an 'entrepreneurial spi rit' with the absence of public social policies, in particular in relation to financing of higher edu cation. Nor should the granting of institutional autonomy be interpreted as a policy alternative to force institutions to raise their own funds  either by excessively contracting out their ser vices to industry or by introducing or raising tuition fees and other study-related charges.  71. Ultimately, if the university or any other higher education institution is expected to make a significant contribution to change and advancement in society, the State and society in general27  should perceive higher education less as a bur den on the public budget and more as a long-term national investment for enhancing economic competitiveness, cultural develop ment and social cohesion. This is also the fra mework within which the problem of cost-sha ring responsibilities needs to be addressed. In conclusion, public support to higher educa tion remains essential to ensure its educatio nal, social and institutional mission.  Renewal of teaching and learning issues of content and delivery  72. To meet the needs of the agenda for sus tainable human development, higher education must adapt its study programmes and, whene ver necessary, adopt and develop new ones. The knowledge explosion has resulted in a conside rable increase in the number of programmes offered by higher education institutions. One characteristic of this explosion is the interde pendence of various scientific disciplines, and there is general consensus on the need to enhan ce the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary content of studies and to increase the effective ness of methods of delivery. Initiatives aimed at the renewal of learning and teaching must reflect such developments.  73. In order to achieve this aim, higher edu cation institutions should re-evaluate the place of teaching in their overall mission and provide incentives which would better reflect the cur rent importance of this activity. At the same time, they should establish numerous  but not necessarily formalized  links with organiza tions, trade and industry. They could help to improve conditions of access and ease partici pation in new forms of higher education. While based on traditional studies, these could also encompass advanced programmes of voca tional training for those unable to follow the traditional system of admission. For instance, more flexible organization of studies and certi fication as well as the development of external programmes with the assistance of new com munication and information technologies would facilitate access for individuals and com munities in rural areas. This would also mean that higher education institutions should make a stronger commitment to the emerging general model of lifelong learning. This would call for the establishment of new types of relations between higher education institutions and  their social partners. It would also imply a continuous analysis of the need for study pro grammes, training and retraining, and would require the establishment of methods for ade quate recognition of work experience relevant to students' academic work and to instructors' teaching qualifications.  74. New roles for higher education will need to be defined to provide lifelong learning opportunities at the highest level. Less formal and more flexible methods of advanced training and updating knowledge and skills must be found. Flexible organizational structures for teaching should not only be in harmony with the existing subtle links between knowledge-generating activities and teaching but should make it easier for specialists from economic and other sectors to teach in higher education institutions. Experienced people from the world of business, government and international organizations could thus inject new idea-s into study programmes.  75. The effectiveness of the renewal of lear ning and teaching also depends on how know ledge is transmitted. It is increasingly evident that under the combined impact of software and hardware development in information and com munication technology, avenues have now been opened up to facilitate new types of educational service. This technology-based learning envi ronment calls for rethinking teaching practices as well as the overall functions of campus-wide information systems. In order to be favourably accepted by the academic community, in parti cular by students and teachers, and to be fully beneficial to learning and teaching, the use of information technology should be judiciously placed on the institutional agendas of commit ment aimed at improving learning, teaching and information services, particularly libraries. Further development of these technologies in higher education also depends on finding satis factory solutions to reconcile the academic community's need for access to information and the interests of the owners of intellectual pro perty rights, especially those involved in com mercial publishing and information exchanges.  76. Higher education institutions should make greater use of the advantages offered by the advancement of communication technologies. It is now possible, for example, to integrate distance learning into more traditional study programmes  28  without loss of quality. As a result of such deve lopments, the distinction between distance and traditional education is becoming blurred. Alternative delivery systems are an increasin gly viable element in a forward-looking blue print for higher education, especially in ope ning up to a new clientele and creating flexible strategies in order to overcome the disadvan tages associated with the traditional organiza tion of studies. Co-operation with both public and private organizations and associations should be fostered in this respect.  77. In this search for new solutions, institu tions in many countries have been looking for alternatives to traditional study programmes through the development of k n o w l e d g e modules. The introduction of modular curricu la as organizational frameworks for studying and teaching warrants further exploration and encouragement. It requires improvement of the system of study counselling, appropriate adjust ments concerning the course ownership and term-structured formats used by many faculties, redesigned student support and tutoring ser vices (especially in distance higher education) and opportunities for study credit and staff transfers between various forms and fields of study.  78. The system of mutual national and inter national recognition of studies, diplomas and degrees should reflect and facilitate this flexible system and stimulate vocational counselling and the upgrading of professional qualifica tions. At the same time, it seems evident that the adoption of modular systems could facilita te the international recognition of studies and diplomas, thus favouring academic flexibility and increased mobility. The need for internatio nal agreements, co-operation mechanisms and practices in this field seems both justified and indispensable.  Strengthening the research function of higher education  79. No system of higher education can fulfil its mission and be a viable partner for society in general unless some of its teaching staff and organizational entities  in accordance with their particular institutional goals, academic potential and material resources  also carry out research. This statement needs to be reiterated particularly now that higher education, in common with other research organizations, needs renewed public  support. Society must restore the scientific 'faith' of researchers to enable them to pursue new goals in the light of the complex ecologi cal, economic, social and cultural issues facing humanity.  80. The research function of higher educa tion has also become characterized by the diversification of those engaged in leading-edge scholarly work. Higher education institutions, particularly in the developed coun tries, face strong competition from research ins titutions outside the academic community which, in many fields, possess better equipment and more resources. On the other hand, the public funds allocated for research in academic institutions are being subjected to greater admi nistrative restrictions. Under such conditions, higher education institutions and researchers themselves have to show their capacity to com pete with other research organizations and adapt to new approaches to funding and to devi se new organizational forms of co-operation in research.  81. Emphasis on short-term gains and the pressure of budgetary constraints can lead to serious long-term consequences for higher edu cation institutions as the proper seats for the advancement of knowledge and the training of future scientists and industrial researchers. Research departments in higher education insti tutions, although costly, are a crucial source of skills and ideas in the context of the global eco nomy based on knowledge and constant tech nological change. The best way to make the general public, government bodies and econo mic organizations aware of the role of research in higher education is to demonstrate, through convincing results, the scholarly quality, econo mic value, humanistic perspective and cultural relevance of research and the related study pro grammes and teaching.  82. Because of the costs involved, many countries, particularly those facing serious eco nomic difficulties, have tended to resort to cuts in funding research in higher education, even though they are sometimes the main, and in many developing countries the only, places where significant research activities take place and where technology suited to local needs can be developed. Meaningful rationalization of research e fforts should incite many countries and institutions, particularly in developing States, to effectively co-ordinate their sometimes29  working o v e r-fragmented research programmes and  in higher education institutions before establish linkages and/or networks of centres  being applied in the system as a whole. Higher where meaningful research can be carried out.  education needs to assume a leading role in the renovation of the entire education sys 83. The educational benefits of activities tem.associated with research are often underestima ted, partly because the links between teaching and research are not always straightforward or tangible. It is important that research in higher education institutions be undertaken not only for reasons of scholarly prestige or for econo mic considerations but also as part of the ove rall renewal and development of learning, tea ching and public service activities, including the dissemination of knowledge. Researchers should therefore also look at how their findings can be included in curricula and retraining pro grammes. Besides its educational value, partici pation in scientific projects teaches students  87. The other persuasive argument for grea ter links between higher education and schools is that teaching at primary and secondary level and in technical and vocational schools increa singly demands the qualities and skills of uni versity-level training, particularly in develo ping students' capacity for autonomous learning and critical thinking. Full command of the dis cipline being taught also calls for periods of in-service training. By playing such a role in the professional development of teachers, higher education can contribute to the improvement of the status of the teaching profession.  how to work as part of a team and to accept the  88.

There is every reason to believe that this will continue in future, given its implications for the develop ment and reform of higher education. Quality 86. This indispensable coherence of the edu cational system stems from the fact that higher education both depends on the results of the work done by prior levels of education and is responsible for the training of teachers for pri mary and secondary education. Moreover, research and innovation, including the develop ment of new educational methods and teaching and learning materials, are often conceptuali zed, developed and tested by those  embraces all its main functions and activities: quality of teaching, training and research, which means the quality of its staff and pro grammes, and quality of learning as a corolla ry of teaching and research. However, it should be accepted that the search for 'quality' has many facets and goes beyond a narrow inter pretation of the academic role of different pro grammes. It therefore also implies attention to questions pertaining to the quality of students and  30  of the infrastructure and academic environ ment. All these quality-related issues, together with adequate concern for good governance and management, play an important role in how a particular institution functions, how it is asses sed and what 'institutional image' it can project to the academic community and society at large. Finally, it is essential to indicate that the principal objective of 'quality assessment' is to achieve institutional as well as system-wide improvement.  Quality of staff and programmes  90. Many higher education establishments, primarily universities and other university-level institutions, enjoy a deserved prestige on the national and international scene. This status is assured principally by the academic eminence of their past and present teachers and resear chers. It represents an important factor in the intellectual and moral authority of academe and for the preservation and promulgation of insti tutional culture and academic standing. It is, however, improper for higher education to take such recognition for granted, especially now that governments, politicians, representatives of the economic sector and the public are insisting on evaluation, quality assessment and the accountability of all kinds of public institution, including higher education establishments.  91. The evaluation and quality assessment process should start with and actively involve the teaching and research staff, given their cen tral role in the diverse activities of higher edu cation institutions. Participation of others, including students in matters related to evalua tion of teaching, should be organized with appropriate recognition of the stakeholders' role with regard to the area of evaluation and assess ment.  92. It is essential that policies as well as practices concerning the academic staff should adhere to unambiguous academic objectives and clear ethical criteria, especially with regard to recruitment and promotion. The decisions should be based on a recognition of predisposi tions for teaching and research. Those respon sible for such decisions should take into account the conclusions of evaluation and quality assessment and provide for various forms of in-service training and professional development schemes, including pedagogical training. The recognition of  assessment and evaluation, which may take such forms as self-evaluation, peer evaluation or external evaluation, should be perceived as an essential mechanism in the overall policy of staff development in higher education. Success or failure in academic work should not, howe ver, be used to justify a short-term outlook and interests.  93. For a variety of reasons, the issue of qua lity assessment of higher education has attrac ted much attention and is now firmly on the policy agenda of higher education, even if the techniques still need to be improved. This cau tion is particularly relevant with regard to 'qua lity' and 'productivity' indicators as evaluation approaches often overlook the intrinsic diffe rences between disciplines or groups of disci plines.  94. The analysis of the quality of academic staff, which should be one of the prerequisites for the renewal of teaching and research, involves the following main issues:   The proper distribution of the resources and tasks constituting the work-load of aca demic staff, i.e. teaching, tutoring, research, participation in institutional governance, management and administration, as well as community service.   The appropriate financial and non-monetary recognition to be given to the above activi ties.   The recruitment and staff development policies, strategies and practices which are integral parts of national and/or institutional policies for higher education and the concern of teachers and their associations to acquire tenure and job security. This brings to the fore the issues of contractual arrange ments for the employment of academic staffs including tenure and the procedures for granting it, promotion, retirement and positions of emeritus professor.  95. The solutions needed to enhance the qua lity of higher education can be found in mea sures covering not only financial issues but also respect for the principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy. However these fundamental principles should not be invoked in order to militate against necessary changes or as a cover for narrow-m i n d e d31  corporatist attitudes and abuse of privileges which may, in the long run, have a negative effect on all aspects of the functioning of the higher education system and its institutions.  Quality of students  96. Participation in higher education is no longer merely a reflection of the social and eco nomic relationships in a given society. It has become a determining factor in such relation ships and influences the overall development of society. Consequently, higher education can play an important role in ensuring upward social as we]l as horizontal professional mobi lity. Equity calls for greater opportunities for members of lower status groups to participate in quality education programmes. The creation of possibilities, particularly for young people, to pursue higher education studies is important for a variety of educational, social and econo mic reasons. But the creation of such possibili ties is linked, particularly when public funding is involved, to investment by society as a whole, and in many countries studying is not a common right for all those who are academi cally eligible.  97. There is every justification for consider ing students as a great asset to society. However, with the advent of mass higher edu cation, it is necessary to engage in a serious debate on a number of basic issues concerning access to higher education. Thus, increasingly pertinent will be such policy questions as:   What mechanisms would enable societies to afford mass higher education in order to observe the principle of social equity?   How can quality be maintained in a mass  higher education system?  98. There are no ready answers, and States and higher education institutions have adopted varying solutions. There is general agreement, however, that the quality of students in higher education depends in the first place on the apti tudes and motivations of those leaving secon dary education and wishing to pursue studies at the higher level  hence the need for a re-exa mination of the interface between higher and secondary education.  99. When faced with the problem of accom modating greater numbers and categories of  student, an obvious solution adopted by both policy-makers and institutions is to diversify programmes and qualifications and to establish a series of entry and exit points within the continuum of higher education. The existence of solid graduate, postgraduate and staff and professional development study programmes is emerging as one way to raise the overall quali ty of the student population in a given institu tion.100. Concern for the quality of students should also include action taken at the institu tional level to provide student counselling and orientation, including the specific problems of international students. This is relevant from the point of view of institutional academic effecti veness and also affects public funding to higher education.  101. Public interest in quality assurance related to students also stems from the fact that modern societies need highly educated and motivated people who can perform appropriate functions in public and private organizations. Societies therefore need suitable higher educa tion systems and should be ready to give quali fied students appropriate incentives. At the same time, it is important to foster among stu dents, particularly those benefiting from public support, an awareness of their civic responsibi lity.  Quality of infrastructure and academic environment  102. One of the barriers to enhancing the quality of teaching and research is the state of what may be broadly described as the 'physical academic environment' of higher education ins titutions, which covers everything from access roads to computerized networking and data processing facilities. The quality of this envi ronment is also important in the context of ins titutional culture, which attaches importance to institutional identity, or keeping together an academically and socially diversified network of buildings and/or campuses.  103. This matter is particularly pertinent in the context of UNESCO's projections showing that participation in higher education by the 18-23 age-group is set to increase. By the year 2025 it will be necessary to provide adequate places for an additional 35 million students. These figures do not include other categories of student  32  (part-timers, for example) whose numbers are rapidly growing in almost all countries.  104. Capital investment aimed at moderniz ing and improving the infrastructure of higher education should be seen by both public and private local, regional and national org a n izations as 'public works' forming an integral and important part of overall efforts towards modernization of the economy-related infra structure. No less important in this respect is the fact that some facilities of higher education ins titutions are often used for civic, cultural and sporting events by both the academic commu nity and the general public.  105. One area which should receive particu lar attention is libraries. The term 'library' has taken on a new meaning in modern academic institutions. It is no longer just a place where books and other printed material relevant to teaching and research are regularly collected, catalogued and preserved. It is increasingly a nerve centre for the interaction between infor mation providers and users on which modern learning, teaching and research greatly depends. Along with archives and museums, libraries provide not only a physical location but also an intellectual context for the storage, preservation and exchange of knowledge.  106. Advocating the modernization of the infrastructure in higher education institutions should not be interpreted as a dismissal of the importance of preserving the institutional and academic heritage, including physical posses sions and collections which in many cases represent a part of the national and universal cultural and architectural heritage.  lnternationalization of higher education  107. The growing internationalization of higher education is first and foremost a reflec tion of the global character of learning and research. This universal context is being rein forced by the current processes of economic and political integration, the growing need for intercultural understanding and the global natu re of modern communications, consumer mar kets, etc. The ever-expanding number of stu dents, teachers and researchers who study, teach, undertake research, live and communica te in an international context attests to this ove rall welcome development.  108. In addition to the increased mobility of individuals, we are witnessing an intensifica tion of transnational research links and conside rable expansion in various types of networking and other linking arrangements among institu tions, academics and students. The steady advance of information and communication technologies facilitates this process. There are, however, serious problems posed by some mis directions of international academic relations. The transfer of knowledge and access to data bases are severely affected by various adverse factors, not always related to educational mat ters; for instance, high-level training and research capabilities are unevenly distributed geographically. Since knowledge is universal, its pursuit, advancement and dissemination can only be achieved through the collective efforts of the international academic community-hence the inherent international dimension of acade mic life and of institutions, scientific societies and student organizations. International co-ope ration is a goal shared by the world academic community; moreover it is a sine qua non for assuring quality and efficiency in the functio ning of institutions of higher education. Higher education has acquired a fundamental role in the development, transfer and sharing of know ledge, and international academic cooperation should bring its contribution to the total deve lopment of human potential. This will help to narrow the gaps between nations and between regions in the fields of science and technology and to improve understanding between indivi duals and between peoples so as to promote the culture of peace.  Principles and forms of international co-operation  109. International co-operation should be based on genuine partnership, mutual trust and solidarity. It should make use of flexible proce dures which allow the participating institutions and/or individuals to address problems re sponsively, and should be aimed at enhancing national, regional and local capacities for the development of human resources. Yet in recent times, the flow of intellectual manpower, which is particularly important for any long -term development strategy, has tended to go in one direction from South to North. Renewed inter-university co-o p e r a t i o n, particularly with the developing countries, should not only entail a rapid transfer of knowledge and technology but should also33  assist promote incentives to retain students, acade  higher education in those countries which mic staff and researchers in their local institu  are facing particular difficulties in developing tions.

It is not unusual to perceive the university-level establishment as part of the institutional machinery of the State instead of seeing it as an essential part of a local community and of society in general. It is essential to persuade the decision-makers and all of society that the latter is the case.  115. The policy of seeking specific solutions stems from a sense of the distinctiveness of many regional, national and local problems. It also relates to the understanding that while knowledge is universal, its application is usual ly local. Higher education depends on and has a responsibility to its local community. This local presence is an integral part of the service mis 112. Beset as they are with serious socio-economic and political problems, many developing countries will not find it easy to divert significant resources towards higher education. It is therefore up to the international academic community and international organizations to  sion of the university or any other higher edu cation institution. But while developing local relevance, institutions should also consolidate their international presence by positively seeking solutions to various scientific, educational and cultural problems which are relevant to society in general.  34  116. Concern for quality also extends to international programmes and exchanges. It should be reiterated that promotion of teaching and research through international academic c o-operation should avoid 'one-way traff i c ' , particularly in the long run. Higher education institutions should assume greater responsibili ty and show restraint in inter-institutional arran gements for 'franchising' teaching and granting degrees because, if not subject to internal and external quality assessment, this can easily jeo pardize the academic standing of the institution.  117. Any far-sighted approach to inter national co-operation in higher education should also seek a correction to the problem of long-term external brain drain. Broader interna tional intellectual exchanges should stimulate an overall improvement in the flexibility, range and quality of higher education and help to remedy some of the causes of external brain drain. Steps that might be taken include arran gements whereby students follow part of their courses at a foreign institution, inducements by the sending countries to their nationals to return home on completing their studies, increased research and library facilities and easier access to scientific data bases for institutions of higher education, particularly those in the developing countries and in Central and Eastern Europe. Also necessary are adequate fincancial and per sonnel policies for the reinsertion of university teachers and researchers in their country of ori gin, even if only for temporary periods. The search for new modalities for the rapid transfer of knowledge through tailor-made programmes is another example of innovative and well-managed international co-operation that can help to alleviate external brain drain.  Access to knowledge  118. The quality gap between academic ins titutions in different parts of the world is a direct reflection of the wider economic and social imbalances existing between developed and developing countries. The serious socio economic situation in many developing coun tries, particularly the LDCs, has had inevitable repercussions on their higher education sys tems. Yet in today's knowledge-intensive world, sound higher education systems are central to any prospects for a reversal of the trend. The question,  then, is how disadvantaged education systems can escape from the vicious circle in which they find themselves.  119. One of the essential first steps  for which the countries and universities concerned must assume primary responsibility  is institu tional reform, and particularly adaptation to specific needs. At the same time, international co-operation for institutional development has a vital role to play in ensuring access to and in facilitating the transfer of knowledge. By virtue of their vocation, higher education institutions should be ready to assume a leading role in ensuring the universal dissemination of know ledge and in promoting the development of their fellow institutions worldwide. The chal lenge is to see that, in a world where rewards and opportunities are unequally distributed, mechanisms are put into place to share know ledge through easier access to recent findings, appropriate academic mobility and increased technical co-operation among regional grou pings.  120. Access to knowledge has an additional dimension for higher education in those develo ping countries which lack resources for deve lopment of their own institutions and pro grammes of advanced studies and research. It is through the development of local skills and competence, through increased numbers of pro viders and users of knowledge, that they can help bridge the gap separating them from the developed countries and thus reduce their dependence on external technical and scientific assistance. In this endeavour, increased partici pation in various forms of international acade mic co-operation would provide protection against long-term external brain drain. Projects such as multi-campus international higher edu cation institutions are particularly worthy of further exploration.  121. In the academic world, as in many other spheres of human activity, the promotion of academic competition, while indispensable for the advancement of knowledge, should not pre clude seeing many aspects of access to scholar ly discoveries from the point of view Of the ideals of academic solidarity. Members of the world's academic community should be concer ned not only about the quality of their own indi vidual institutional setting, but also about the quality of higher education and research eve rywhere.  35  Networking for academic excellence  122. While it is imperative for each institu tion of higher education to aspire towards excellence, none of them can ever hope to attain the highest standards in every field. This is why i n t e r-university co-operation is becoming increasingly important to avoid the marginal ization of certain institutions, particularly in the developing countries, and to make academic excellence more readily available through a 'division of tasks' among universities that trans cends national frontiers. An interlocking system of international postgraduate and research centres can provide an important boost to higher education within a given region and can help to promote South-South co-o p e r a t i o n , especially when such arrangements are based on common interests and adequately shared financial responsibilities.  123. Modern technological advances make the creation and functioning of such centres look particularly promising. They allow the expansion of the concept of academic mobility so as to include not only the traditional mobili ty of students, teachers and researchers, but also a sort of mobility in reverse, placing researchers from centres of excellence at the disposal of students, teachers and researchers of institu tions in distant and disadvantaged places. This can be done through electronic networks, videocassettes, CD-ROMs and other modern forms of communication. These new technolo gies should also make it possible to tackle the problem of dissemination of research findings by researchers working in higher education ins titutions in the developing countries.  36  V. Change and developpement in higher education  the role of UNESCO  124. The development of higher education  126. One of the focal points of UNESCO's and the promotion of research through interna  role for the further development of higher edu tional co-operation have been major fields of  cation has been the Organization's sustained action for UNESCO since its foundation in  contribution to the creation and strengthening 1946.

The analysis of issues and challenges facing higher education and the international experience acquired by UNESCO in this field enable the following guidelines for its future work to be identified: 125. The achievement of basic education f o r a l l, reiterated during the Jomtien Conference, is UNESCO's priority in the field   broadening access and participation in  higher education; of education. It goes hand in hand with concern for the renewal and advancement of education   enhanced investment in education, including at all levels and with the need to reform the  higher education, through worldwide mobil education system as a whole. In this respect,  ization of all stakeholders so as to secure a higher education plays an important role becau  broader funding base; se it is the enhancement of its relevance and quality that creates the conditions for progress in education at all other levels. Not only is higher education responsible for the training of teachers and other education personnel, but its mission also includes educational research  as   improving the relevance of higher education by responding to the challenges of a chan ging world at international, regional, natio nal and community levels;  the basis for policy and decision-making in this field  as well as curriculum reform and the development of teaching methods and mate rials. Recognition of the connection between   enhancing the quality of higher education in all its functions and with regard to all those participating in its activities; higher education and the other levels of educa tion, its links with the development of science   promoting the role of research in higher edu and technology and awareness of its role as a  cation; key element for sustainable human develop ment have led UNESCO to make higher edu cation a priority area in its programme.   furtherance of academic freedom and insti  tutional autonomy;   expanding international co-operation in higher education and giving a sense of direc tion to that co-operation in a spirit of acade mic solidarity.  Broadening of access and participation  128. The Convention against Discrimination in Education, adopted by UNESCO in 1960, urges the States party to it 'to make primary education free and compulsory; make seconda ry education in its different forms generally available and accessible to all; make higher education equally accessible to all on the basis of individual capacity'. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the United Nations in 1989, also emphasized that 'higher education should be made, by every appropria te means, accessible to all, on the basis of capa city'. In keeping with these internationally agreed principles and given the disparities of access to higher education, UNESCO will continue to promote broader access in its agen da and activities on development and change in higher education.  129. The principles of broadening participa tion in higher education and ensuring equity of access have been regularly endorsed by the General Conferences of UNESCO and by the International Conferences on Education and the regional conferences of ministers of education convened under its auspices. This policy has also received support at various other meetings organized by UNESCO with its partners in higher education. It has been reinforced by ana lyses and studies, particularly on the situation in the developing countries and on women's parti cipation in higher education. The pressure for increased access is a major challenge for many countries and regions, particularly those where it is difficult to secure the necessary inputs in terms of personnel, finance and logistics. UNESCO will, accordingly, pay due attention to this problem.  Searching for a wider resource basis  130. In UNESCO's opinion, the central issue of matching increasing demands on and expec tations from higher education with the scarcity of resources requires mobilization of all actors and stakeholders in order to raise investment in higher education. The Organization also stresses the need to:   recognize higher education as an important social investment and therefore make ade quate allocations for it from public funds;   engage in an earnest search for new approaches to funding, based on participa tion by all those who either directly or indi rectly derive benefit from higher education, including the economic sector, local com munities, parents, students and the interna tional community.  131. Broadening the resource basis should also be accompanied by systematic efforts by the higher education institutions themselves to increase their cost-effectiveness and efficiency. UNESCO will therefore continue, in close co-operation with other international organiz ations and with the higher education communi ty as a whole, to urge extended public support for higher education. At the same time the Organization will follow national and institutio nal experiences on various cost-sharing and stu dent support schemes and cost recovery poli cies, and will examine their long-term implica tions on access, equity of participation and sus tainable institutional financing.  Fostering relevance and quality  132. UNESCO notes that concurrent trends and global challenges make it necessary to rethink and reform higher education and its ins titutions in practically all countries and regions. Quantitative growth is far from uniform at the world level. But the significant growth in both the numbers of students and of institutions calls for adequate responses to what is sometimes termed the 'massification' of higher education. Greater numbers require co-ordinated policies, structures and programmes, which are the basic ingredients of any educational reform. T h e same is true of the increasingly diverse demands that society places upon higher educa tion, covering the economic, social, cultural and scientific fields. Profound changes in the advancement, production, dissemination and application of knowledge, of which higher edu cation is an integral part, also call for renewal and reform. The unprecedented rate of expan sion of scientific activities requires the updating of curricula and programmes, greater flexibility of organizational structures and a better unders tanding of the economic and ethical aspects Of scientific activities. Progress in the educational  38  sciences and a better understanding of learning processes are also conducive to change and innovation in higher education.  133. UNESCO will follow these develop ments attentively and will continue to contribu te to the reform and development of higher edu cation. However, it does not intend to formula te ready-made plans or impose specific models for the development and functioning of higher education This is the prerogative of each coun try and its government, working inconcertation with all stakeholders, the institutions of higher education and the academic community, inclu ding students.  134. One of UNESCO's main roles in the collective effort to promote change and deve lopment in higher education is to facilitate the exchange of information and experience and to promote research on higher education which is relevant to policy and decision making. By serving as a kind of clearing house, UNESCO can respond to the prerequisites for informed decision-making by supplying data and analyses and by monitoring changes and trends in higher education. The Organization will, accordingly, further its work in co-opera tion with its traditional partners for the deve lopment of viable higher education and scienti fic statistics and indicators, including the refi nement of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Furthermore, through its biennial Wo r l d Education Report and World Science Report, it will monitor developments in the field of higher education and science while identifying the emerging challenges, including those of facili tating access to and the transfer of knowledge.  135. UNESCO will continue to act in favour of preserving and enhancing diversity among higl1er education institutions and systems, which it regards as an important asset of acade mic life in general and as a prerequisite for the advancement of knowledge and the preserva tion of national and local cultural identities. This policy is reinforced by experience, which has demonstrated how damaging it is for the academic and intellectual development of a country to uncritically adopt foreign models for its own higher education. History has shown that the most viable systems of higher educa tion are those which exhibit the right balance between unity and diversity, a reflection  of the universality of knowledge and the speci ficity of social, economic and cultural needs.  136. In its commitment to the need for diversity, relevance and quality in higher edu cation, UNESCO has continuously decentral ized its programmes in the field to its Regional O ffices and centres such as the European Centre for Higher Education (CEPES) and the Regional Centre for Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean (CRESALC). This policy will be continued. UNESCO will also emphasize technical and intellectual support to governments and to the 'bodies in charge of higher education, as well as activities aimed directly at improving governance and manage ment and enhancing quality, While stressing the need for systemic, national and international development of higher education, UNESCO will also give due attention to institutional development. Recognizing the importance of co-operation between higher education and its economic partners, UNESCO will promote such activity, especially in the context of its U N I S PAR (University-I n d u s t r y S c i e n c e Partnership) programme.  137. One of the principles on which UNES CO is founding its relations with all its partners involved in higher education is respect for aca demic freedom and institutional autonomy. This derives from experience and from the conviction that adherence to these two prin ciples is a prerequisite for the normal functio ning of higher education institutions and for the success of reform. In response to an appeal by the academic community, UNESCO will conti nue to support the development of internatio nally accepted principles and practices concer ning academic freedom and the autonomy of higher education institutions, and the enhance ment of the status of higher education tea chers, in conformity with standards adopted worldwide.  Expansion of international co-operation  138. In keeping with its constitutional mis sion 'to maintain, increase and diffuse knowled ge... by encouraging... the international exchan ge of persons active in the field of education, science and culture, UNESCO will continue to give priority to activities aimed at promoting worldwide, regional and interregional  39  priorities co-operation in the field of higher education.

It was with this in mind that UNESCO took a decision at 139. The analysis of the internationalization of higher education made earlier in this policy paper identified major trends and developments which, in conjunction with ongoing social, eco nomic and cultural challenges, have also affec ted the level and forms of international acade mic co-operation.

The programme aims to strengthen academic co-operation with particular emphasis on support to higher educa tion institutions in the developing countries and in Central and Eastern Europe. education. UNESCO's response has taken the form of a set of organizational measures and a search for new approaches and activities spread over all its programmes in the fields of educa tion, science, culture and communication.  143. The programme is designed to develop network linkages among higher education ins titutions at the interregional, regional and subregional levels, with the aim of promoting institutional development, sharing of  140. UNESCO will continue to extend its support to and co-operate closely with those NGOs which play an active role in promoting regional and international co-operation in the  resources and facilitating the exchange of expertise and experience as well as of staff and students. It is based on the spirit of acade mic solidarity needed to set in motion a process leading to strong and durable links between fields of education, science, culture and com  higher education and scientific institutions munication.

In this context, the programme will take into account a recent initiative of the O rganization called 'Management of Social Transformations' (MOST) which is aimed at  141.

The programme has been initiated in full awareness of the fact that it requires consi derable resources as well as an adequate moni toring and review system. UNESCO will conti nue to seek organizational and financial support for the programme, in close co-operation with governments, intergovernmental organizations, donor agencies, the public and private sectors and higher education institutions. T h e Organization will also pay close attention to other innovative, cost-efficient forms of imple mentation of all its activities related to interna tional academic co-operation. In this context, the possibility of setting up a U n i v e r s i t y Volunteers Scheme, following the model of the United Nations Volunteers Programme, will be pursued.  146. UNESCO has a long-standing commit ment to the development and promotion of international co-operation in higher education through the recognition of studies and qualifications. The five regional conventions on the recognition of studies, diplomas and degrees in higher education adopted under the auspices of UNESCO over the last two decades attest to this commitment: Latin America and tl1c Caribbean (1974), the Arab States (1978), the Europe Region (1979), the A f r i c a n States (1981) and Asia and the Pacific (1983). An International Convention on the  Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in the Arab and European States bordering the Mediterranean was adop ted in 1976. An International Recommendation on the Recognition of Studies and Qualifications in Higher Education was adop ted by the General Conference of UNESCO at its twenty-seventh session, in 1993. Thus a glo bal framework has been created that can also serve to deal with academic co-operation. The ongoing processes of economic, cultural and political integration will be taken into account in the activities geared towards implementation of these conventions.  147. The practical significance of these stan dard-setting instruments depends on the effecti ve activities carried out by the Regional Committees and national bodies entrusted with the task of following up and facilitating the application of their provisions. Consequently, UNESCO will continue to support the activities of those bodies and to promote various forms of student and staff mobility through evaluation of study programmes and degrees, development of data bases, assistance in building up national accreditation mechanisms and publications such as Study Abroad and the World Guide to Higher Education.  41  VI. Towards a renewal of higher education  the ‘pro-active university’ and the ‘new academic covenant’  42  148. Advocated in this policy paper is a   a place of learning founded on quality and vision of higher education which, while reco gnizing it as one of the most important compo nents of contemporary and future society, also calls for a renewal of its teaching, learning, research and service functions and ultimately of the institutions of higher education themselves.  knowledge alone, which inculcates, particu larly in the minds of its future graduates, commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and a sense of responsibility to place training at the service of social development; At the same time the complexity, interdepen dence and pertinence of many global, regional,   a place that welcomes return for updating national and local issues is such that dealing  and enhancement of knowledge and qualifi with them only reactively risks marginalization  cations as part of institutional practice and of the institutions which adopt such a stand, particularly in the long term.

This vision of a 'pro-active university' will also guide UNESCO in the development and implementation of its activities in the field of higher education. The goal of the action in which all stakeholders need to participate is to turn every institution of higher education into:  tions are identified, debated and addressed in a spirit of learned criticism, and where the active participation of citizens in the debates on social, cultural and intellectual progress is encouraged;  a place for high-quality training, enabling stu   a place to which governments and other dents to act efficiently and effectively in a  public institutions can go for scientific and broad range of civic and professional functions  reliable information which is increasingly and activities, including the most diverse,  being required for decision-making at all up-to-date and specialized;  levels, and which also promotes public par   a place to which access is possible primarily  ticipation in the decision-making process;  on the basis of intellectual merit and of the ability to participate actively in its pro grammes, with due attention to ensuring social equity;   a community whose members, being fully committed to the principles of academic freedom, are engaged in the pursuit of truth, defence and promotion of human rights,  a community fully engaged in the search, creation and dissemination of knowledge, in  democracy, social justice and tolerance in their own communities and throughout the the advancement of science, and particip  world, and participate in instruction for ating in the development of technological  genuine participatory citizenship and in buil innovations and inventions;  ding a culture of peace;   an institution well situated in the world context, with all its accompanying threats and possibilities, and adapted to the rhythm of contemporary life, the distinctive features of each region, and of each country.  150. This broad vision of the 'pro-active uni versity' implies its creative adaptation in the process of searching for specific institutional models and practices which meet the needs, conditions and possibilities of particular higher education institutions, communities, countries and regions. Such a search for the development and change of higher education should also be seen as an essential part of the broad process of changes in contemporary society.  Responsibility for the actual form and measures of implementation of the renewed higher edu cation system belongs to every country and to its academic community  yet in a fast changing world, no country can consider itself isolated from the influences of international events and developments.  151. UNESCO anticipates, as a concluding objective of the whole process of change and development in higher education elaborated in this document, the emergence of a new 'acade mic covenant' that will place higher education in all its Member States in a better position to respond to the present and future needs of sus tainable human development.  43
