Common Course Rules - Bachelor Degree
INTRODUCTION
In Higher Education (HE), all courses offered by the University must comply with national regulatory
requirements, for example the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), and many courses are also
accredited through professional organisations. The University as a self-accrediting institution has a Council
that determines course rules which provide course structures and rules for HE awards. These course rules
apply to HE AQF Levels 5 to 10.
For each category of award there is a common set of rules applicable to all programs leading to an award
in that category. In addition, each course may have associated with it specific rules that apply only to that
course in addition to the common rules; specific rules are described in the course curriculum
documentation.
STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY
The authority behind this policy is the Charles Darwin University Act 2003 section 47 under the authority
of the Council.
COMPLIANCE
This is a compliance requirement under the Australian Qualifications Framework.
RELEVANT DEFINITIONS
In the context of this document
Award means a recognised certification of achievement or competence which may be granted to a student
after successful completion of all the requirements of a course;
Combined course means an approved program of study leading to two qualifications for which all
requirements have been met. Such a program of study may require a longer period of study than for the
individual courses of which it is comprised, but the total study period may be less than that required to
meet the requirements of the qualifications individually;
Common Units means a group of units intended, to provide an introduction to higher education study, and
to assist students to develop a degree of academic literacy and the capacity to critically explore social and
cultural issues of local, national and international relevance. Common units are offered at the 100 level
only;
Core unit means a unit that is compulsory for the course;
Course means a formally approved/accredited program of learning that leads to the award of a
qualification;
Credit point means a value allocated to individual higher education units to indicate their contribution to
the overall course requirements and to the enrolment load of a student e.g. a 10 credit point unit
represents a quarter of a standard load for a semester;

control, is not reasonably foreseeable and which prevents the student from engaging in a University activity
such as: accepting an international offer of a place, withdrawing from a unit prior to census/cut-off date,
completing the requirements for an unit of study or attending a scheduled examination. Examples may
include sudden illness or disability; loss of employment; an inability to obtain a student visa; death of the
student or a close family member (parent, sibling, spouse or child); natural catastrophe; or a political or
civil uprising;
Specialist elective means a unit selected by the student from a group of units identified as highly relevant
to the course;
Standard load means a real or notional program of learning which a full-time student would be required to
undertake in a full year of a particular course. The University has adopted 80 credit points as its standard
load; and

“What is International Baccalaureate?” and other FAQs
International Baccalaureate (IB) is a worldwide, nonprofit education program founded to give all students the opportunity to receive an education fit for a globalizing world. There are four IB education programs, all of which are intended to develop students’ intellectual, emotional, personal and social skills. High school students will mostly be concerned with the IB Diploma Program (DP) and the Career-related Program (CP), which consist of six main subjects.

Who is eligible for an International Baccalaureate program?
International Baccalaureate’s mission is to offer education to all students, so any high school student between 16 and 19 years old can apply for the program. IB doesn’t have any other restrictions, but individual schools may have GPA requirements, and many have limited spots in their programs, so the application process can be competitive. Students should check with their counselors for their IB program’s specific requirements.

How do I become an International Baccalaureate student?
Students interested in joining the IB program usually need to complete an application by a specified deadline, which can be found on their IB school’s website or through school counselors. Applications may require teacher recommendation letters, grade reports, essays, writing samples or a personal statement, vaccination reports and a list of extracurricular activities. Students may also have to live within a certain distance from the school offering the IB program.

How does the Career-related Program differ from the Diploma Program?
The CP is similar to a vocational college program; it allows students to gain professional skills while in high school. CP students are exposed to the academic rigor and theoretical knowledge of the Diploma Program by taking two DP courses, but they also take a set of core classes specific to the CP as well as career-specific classes. Learn more about the CP and its different set of graduation requirements and assessments here.

When should I enroll in an International Baccalaureate program?
While the DP and CP programs technically don’t begin until a student’s junior year, IB students start taking prep courses as soon as they enter high school. Because of this, the application process typically begins in 8th grade, about a year before a student starts their freshman year. Specific dates and deadlines vary between programs, so students and their families should check with counselors and their intended IB program for details.

Are there International Baccalaureate programs near me?
Maybe! Every state has at least one IB program. Check this directory to find the IB program nearest you.

Is there any cost involved in International Baccalaureate?
It does not cost anything to become an IB student. However, the IB assessment tests, which can lead to college credit with a passing score, do have fees ranging from $10 to $170. Learn more about registration fees and subject fees at the International Baccalaureate website.

How International Baccalaureate Helps for College
The IB emphasizes personal student development as one of its main achievements, and it’s true that IB provides an enriching high school experience. But prospective IB students who are looking ahead toward post-secondary education should be pleased to know that IB graduates also benefit from being extremely well-prepared for college in a number of different ways. Below are just a handful of the academic perks of enrolling in an IB program.

Colleges love it
Colleges always like to see prospective students challenge themselves, and those who risk their GPAs in order to take a more rigorous course of study stand out more than students with excellent GPAs who took a lighter course load.

AP vs. IB: Choosing Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate
Students and families who are looking into more challenging alternatives to the traditional high school curriculum may come across Advanced Placement (AP) options along with IB. Both programs offer college-level courses to high school students, but there are many key differences that should be examined before determining whether one is a better fit over the other. Noting the similarities and differences between these programs can help students make the right decision for them and their academic and personal goals.

Tips for Choosing and Thriving in International Baccalaureate
Preparing for IB can be an intimidating and, at times, confusing process. Both deciding on an IB program and doing well once enrolled takes a lot of early preparation. These tips can help students determine whether or not IB is a good fit for them, and can help ensure they stay on track and get the most from their IB program without getting overwhelmed.

Tips For Choosing An IB Program
Ask those who have already done IB
Not all IB programs are the same, so it’s wise to talk to students who have gone through the program and see how they felt about their experience and the program’s quality.

Shadow your intended program
Students often have the ability to visit their intended IB program and see for themselves how the program works.

Assess your learning style
Know that IB isn’t for everyone, and it’s okay for students to decide that the program doesn’t fit their learning style. IB is very writing-intensive, can involve a lot of group projects and challenges students to think critically about potentially controversial subjects in order to gain a strong understanding of cultural differences.

Understand your goals
Doing well in an IB program can help students get into top colleges, but if that is the only reason for enrolling in IB, students may want to consider options like AP. IB is an in-depth and rigorous program intended for students seeking personal and academic growth, and those simply looking to boost their college applications may find it isn’t worth the stress and time commitment.

Consider distance
Often, students need to travel to get to the nearest IB program. The feasibility of this should be taken into account when deciding if IB is a good fit.

Talk to counselors about alternatives
Students and their families should talk to school counselors to make sure they are aware of and understand IB and its alternatives. Students set on IB may find that another program they hadn’t heard about actually suits them better.

Tips For Thriving In An IB Program
Advice from an Expert: Is International Baccalaureate Right for Me?
Dr. Robert Bouressa is the Director of College Guidance for Saint Andrew’s School in Boca Raton, FL. He is the former Diploma Coordinator for IB Students at Saint Andrew’s, and now counsels IB students on college choice. Prior to joining the school, he spent 10 years as the Director of Admission and College Counseling and worked within the IB program at the Escola Americana do Rio de Janeiro.

How can students (and their families) determine whether or not an IB program is right for them? Comparing IB with other programs, like AP, is a good start. Both are rigorous programs devoted to educational excellence, and both programs involve dedicated and creative teachers committed to their students, their disciplines and their profession. AP and IB attract highly motivated students who wish to excel academically and attend the most selective colleges and universities as well as the attention of international educators, educational policymakers and the general public as ways to improve the quality of education around the world. It is important to have a good understanding of your learning style when deciding if IB is a good fit. Why might someone choose an IB program over AP courses, Running Start-style programs, early college magnet schools or similar alternatives to traditional high school curricula? Given the classes in a typical IB program run over two years, the AP offers greater opportunity to take a broad variety of classes. However, IB has a stronger emphasis on global perspective than AP, which has a predominantly Western perspective. The IB program is also more divergent than convergent, asking “why” more than “what”. AP allows students to take classes that play to their strengths and are graded independent of one another. IB, on the other hand, is a course of study, encompassing six areas: English, history, science, foreign language, math and an IB-approved elective. There is also a great amount of writing in the IB program. Even math and science students must write in-depth research papers. Are there any common mistakes, assumptions or pitfalls regarding IB that hinder student success? How can they be avoided? Not having a good idea of the commitment that it takes to complete all the requirements of the IB program. It is a very rigorous program, but any student that is committed to learning can achieve the diploma through a dedicated approach to their studies.
Requirements for the Bachelor’s Degree
Students are responsible for ensuring that they have met all degree requirements, including general education requirements and requirements for majors, minors and concentrations.

Graduation from the university with the award of the appropriate degree (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Science in Education, Bachelor of Fine Arts, or Bachelor of Music) will be granted to students who fulfill the following requirements.

They must earn a minimum of 120 unduplicated credit hours.
They must complete all required courses in a particular major program, the General Education requirements of the General Education Program, and sufficient elective credits to make up the total required credit hours, with a minimum cumulative quality point average of 2.00. The student must also have a minimum cumulative quality point average of 2.00 in courses required for his/her major, minor, and concentration. Students should see department sections for any variation from this requirement.
Except for certain programs, students pursuing the B.A. or B.S. degree must earn a minimum of 66 hours in credits from disciplines other than their major discipline. For either the B.A. or B.S., students in multi-discipline major programs may not apply more than 45 hours in any one discipline toward credits needed for graduation.
All students must take a minimum of 45 semester hours at Fredonia. In order to count towards this requirement, a course must be taught by a SUNY Fredonia faculty member. This shall include courses taught by Fredonia faculty via distance education and up to 15 credits earned through study abroad under the INED subject code.
Under ordinary circumstances, students will have 10 consecutive years during which to complete the requirements for the undergraduate degrees in effect at the time they began their studies. If they wish to complete the degree after 10 years, their record of studies will be reviewed by the chairperson of the academic department in which their major falls, and by their academic dean, to determine how much of their earlier credit is still applicable. This rule applies not only to credit earned at Fredonia, but also to credit transferred to Fredonia from other colleges or universities. In addition, after 10 years, students will generally be required to complete the current General Education Program requirements. The CCC Director will review the student’s record of studies to determine how much of his/her earlier general education credit is still applicable.
This policy notwithstanding, to the extent that certifying agencies change the requirements for a particular degree within the student’s original 10-year period or later, students will be bound by the new requirements of the agency.

Candidates in a program leading to certification to teach in New York State must satisfactorily complete all student teaching requirements. No grade less than S gives credit in student teaching.
Music students must meet certain accompanying and performance standards, and secondary Instrument competencies. Details on these requirements may be secured from the School of Music.
Students must meet all their financial obligations to the university and any or all of its supporting agencies.
A student who expects to graduate at a given date must make application through the Registrar’s office, not later than the third full week of classes of the final semester of attendance.
All students seeking an undergraduate degree must complete 45 credit hours at the upper-level (300 level courses and above). Please see your advisor for additional information regarding courses that will satisfy this requirement.
NOTE:

Only 4 credit hours of physical education activities courses (100-level courses) may count toward the total number of credit hours needed for graduation.
Not more than 6 credit hours of arts ensemble courses (e.g., MUS 021-047, DANC 110) may be counted toward the total number of credit hours needed for graduation, unless this rule is overridden by a requirement/limit stipulated by the student's major.
A maximum of 24 credit hours of internship credit may count toward the number of credit hours needed for graduation.
Credit for a course may not be counted more than once, unless the course has been designated by the department as an exception to this rule.

The concept of basic education programme was reinforced and expanded by the World Declaration on Education for All adopted by the Jomtien Conference held in 1990. This expanded vision of education will help the people firstly to acquire survival life skills through pre-school education, primary education and functional literacy programmes. Secondly to acquire knowledge and skills to improve their quality of life, and attitude and habit of lifelong learning through continuing education programmes. The world is going through a process of change which is unprecedented in its magnitude and implication. This phenomenon is specially noticeable in the Asia-Pacific Region where the progress is much faster and implications are far more profound. APPEAL has made a survey of continuing education programmes in various countries. The survey revealed that the countries were organizing continuing education programmes under different names such as post-literacy, adult education, non-formal education, etc. The Second Meeting for Regional Co-ordination of APPEAL (Bangkok, 1990) decided to classify continuing education into six categories, they are (1) Post-Literacy Programmes (PLP), (2) Equivalency Programme (EP), (3) Quality of Life Improvement Programme (QLIP), (4) Income-Generating Programme (IGP), (5) Individual Interest Promotion Programme (IIP), and (6) Future Oriented Programme (FOP). Following the decision UNESCO/PROAP developed following manuals under the general title of APPEAL Training Materials for Continuing Education Personnel (ATLP-CE) ATLP-CE Volume I : Continuing Education: New Policies and Directions ATLP-CE Volume II : Post-Literacy Programmes (PLP) ATLP-CE Volume III : Equivalency Programmes (EP) ATLP-CE Volume IV : Quality of Life Improvement Programmes (QLIP) ATLP-CE Volume V : Income-Generating Programmes (IGP) ATLP-CE Volume VI : Individual Interest Promotion Programmes (IIP) ATLP-CE Volume VII : Future-Oriented Programmes(FOP) ATLP-CE Volume VIII : Learning Centre Development Programmes These volumes have been conceived, developed and written by the experts on continuing education in the countries in the region. Therefore, they have combined theory and practice into i suitable manuals and made them flexible so that each country can adopt and adapt them according to the situation and needs. These volumes are designed to act as source material for launching continuing education programmes. UNESCO/PROAP hope that each country will develop its own system of continuing education. A number of Regional and Sub-Regional Workshops are planned to train key personnel who would be working for continuing education in their countries. ATLP-CE will provide basic materials for such workshops. I hope the countries will also use them in their national workshops. In the end I would like to express UNESCO’s grateful thanks to all the experts who have contributed to conceptualise, develop and write ATLP-CE. I would like to request all the experts of continuing education to make suggestion to improve the series continuously. I firmly believe that in this ever changing panorama practitioners of education should not be silent spectators but the main actors to induce the change in the right direction. Hedayat Ahmed Director, UNESCO/PROAP ii I N T R O D U C T I O N Asia-Pacific Programme of Education for All (APPEAL) has the following Action Areas : 1. Universalization of Primary Education (UPE) 2. Eradication of Illiteracy (EOI) 3. Continuing Education for Development (CED) UNESCO Principal Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (PROAP) has been working very closely with the Member States to expand and improve Primary Education and Literacy Programmes. Specifically APPEAL Training Materials for Literacy Personnel (ATLP) has helped improve the quality of curriculum, learning materials and training for literacy programmes in Asia and the Pacific. Based on the experiences of ATLP, UNESCO/PROAP is developing APPEAL Training Materials for Continuing Education Personnel (ATLP-CE). It organized a Planning Meeting on 16-20 April 1990 in Hua Hin, Thailand, and developed the First Volume of ATLP-CE entitled: «Continuing Education: New Policies and Directions.» The Planning Meeting prepared guidelines for the preparation of training manuals for the following six types of Continuing Education Programmes: 1. Post-Literacy Programmes 2. Equivalency Programmes 3. Quality of Life Improvement Programmes 4. Income-Generating Programmes 5. Individual Interest Promotion Programmes 6. Future-Oriented Programmes UNESCO/PROAP has convened a series of Technical Working Group Meetings of Experts and developed eight volumes of ATLP-CE. This book is the first in the set. ATLP-CE is an extension of the twelve volumes set of APPEAL Training Materials for Literacy Personnel (ATLP) and it is recommended that readers be reasonably familiar with the series before reading this volume. This first volume gives a general overview of continuing education and describes the scope and development of ATLP-CE. Under ATLP-CE continuing education is defined very broadly as the provision of opportunities for lifelong learning. In the long run continuing education should be seen as the mechanism for establishing a learning society. The concept of a learning society as defined by UNESCO implies that education is a function of all agencies of society, not just those which traditionally have been given a primarily educational role such as iii schools and colleges. Continuing Education, therefore promotes lifelong learning everywhere in the society through formal and non-formal channels and through informal learning. The point is stressed that continuing education is the means by which human resource development can occur and hence how socio-economic development can be based on a knowledgeable, skilled and self reliant citizenry. It is argued that an effective continuing education system should be organized in relation to overall national development plans. An effective infrastructure needs to be established, personnel should be trained and effective delivery systems developed. Entry points into continuing education should be available for all citizens. The provision of opportunities for lifelong learning, that is the availability of continuing education, should be freely open to all. The range of continuing education providers needs to be very broad to cater for the types of learning required by all citizens. In a developing country there is probably need for a very obvious entry point into such a complex and diverse system and the emergence of local learning centres is proposed to satisfy that need. This volume also comments on the types of continuing education activities appropriate for the present stage of development of the Region and provides some broad guidelines for their design and implementation. T.M. SAKYA Co-ordinator «APPEAL» iv Chapter 1 THE CONTEXT OF CONTINUING EDUCAT I O N A. The Learning Society and Lifelong Learning As most countries of Asia and the Pacific move towards universal basic literacy they are challenged by a most significant further step in development. This is their emergence as learning societies. The idea of a learning society was first advanced by UNESCO almost twenty years ago in its famous report Learning to Be.1 According to this UNESCO Report, a learning society is one in which all agencies of a society are educational providers, not just those whose primary responsibility is education (e.g. schools). For example while the primary responsibility of a factory is not education but the manufacture of goods it can and should have an educational role as well. It can provide training for its employees and also can educate the general public about its processes and products, its environmental policies and its societal contributions. Another aspect of a learning society is that all citizens should be engaged in learning, taking full advantage of the opportunities provided by the learning society. At the time that this idea was first formulated it made very little impact on education in the Third World as most developing countries considered it to be an unattainable ideal, at least in their foreseeable future. They concentrated instead on the development of formal education, especially on the achievement of Universal Primary Education. That attitude has now changed. Many countries with low levels of basic literacy in the 1970s have now attained more than 80 per cent adult literacy and many have almost achieved universal literacy. Many countries which twenty years ago were economically disadvantaged have become Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs). The idea of a learning society no longer seems to be an unrealistic ideal but a real possibility and a goal for planned development. If there is a genuine learning society then all citizens engage in education from birth to death education is lifelong. Purposive, self-planned and self-initiated learning becomes central to the lives of all adults. Each individual sets a series of learning objectives and then pursues these by any means available through the many agencies provided by the learning society. As citizens become more aware of the power and significance of education as an agency for improving their lives they tend to plan out longer term learning goals and to «add in» shorter term learning experiences to meet immediate needs. Lifelong planning involving continuous education and training is undertaken by all. In this situation however, education must be seen to be something much broader and more significant than «schooling» alone. As needs arise adults can draw on programmes offered by formal education, non formal education and informal education as these sub-sectors are traditionally defined. Some of this learning may be highly * Faure, Edgar et al Learning to Be: The World of Education Today and Tomorrow, Paris, UNESCO, 1972. 1 structured through attendance at a formal course of study, some may be relatively unstructured, through working in casual learning groups or by independent study; some may be through programmes offered by Departments of Non-Formal Education which aim to provide formal qualifications by alternative non formal means; other forms of learning may be provided by employers through in-house or on the job training and retraining; and so on. Learning needs change as adults take on new roles, and as they get older education tends to be less structured and to draw more and more on informal opportunities for learning. B. Continuing Education and Lifelong Learning Under APPEAL, the UNESCO Sub-Regional Seminar on Continuing Education held in Canberra, Australia, in November 1987, defined continuing education as a «broad concept which includes all of the learning opportunities all people want or need outside of basic literacy education and primary education». This definition implies the following: i) Continuing education is for literate youth and adults ii) It is responsive to needs and wants iii) It can include experiences provided by the formal, non-formal and informal education sub-sectors iv) It is defined in terms of «opportunity» to engage in lifelong learning after the conclusion of primary schooling or its equivalent. The relationship between lifelong learning and continuing education, therefore, can be shown by a simple diagram (Figure 1.1). In this diagram the central columns show how educational programmes can be planned and sequenced by an individual throughout life. These programmes may be from the formal, non-formal or informal sub-sectors of education and continuing education is the opportunity provided by the learning society to engage in the learning. 2 INDIVIDUALLIFELINE EDUCATION LIFELONG EDUCATIONAL «SYSTEM» PROJECTS PROGRAMMES Figure 1.1: The relationship between liflong learning and continuing education. The bands represent individual learning projects. C. Systems of Education The terms «formal» and «non formal» and informal» are defined by various educators and educational systems in different ways and there is some confusion and overlap between these ideas and the concept of continuing education. Under APPEAL, therefore, it is proposed to use the term formal to apply to programmes offered by established educational institutions such as schools, technical colleges and universities and to use the term non-formal for courses and programmes offered outside the formal system. The term informal education is more controversial. Some Member States may prefer not to use this term at this stage of their educational development yet it is at the heart of the concept of continuing education. It should not be confused with the term «informal learning» which occurs incidentally and casually from 3 day-to-day observation and experience. All education is purposive and has same degree Of structure. The term «informal education», therefore, refers to educational programmes initiated, and organized by individual learners who set and pursue in a structured way, the achievement of specific objectives independently of any system or agency, either formal or non-formal. Incidentally, one of the key aims of continuing education is to promote and foster informal learning so that adults are empowered to structure and pursue any educational project that they may wish to undertake without being dependent on courses or programmes formal or non-formal, provided by systems or institutions. This type of approach to the three terms avoids confusion between the concepts of «non formal education» and «continuing education» and allows continuing education to be pursued formally, non-formally or by informal self learning according to need. It makes it clear that continuing education and non-formal education are NOT the same thing, but that continuing education can draw on both formal and non-formal education. In many countries, however, it must be recognized that there are government ministries or departments with the title «Department of Non-Formal Education» and these are usually responsible for all those aspects of continuing adult education which occur outside the formal education system. Most, however, give greatest emphasis to equivalency programmes which provide formal qualifications by alternative means. Making the term non-formal education equivalent to the concept «continuing education» as a whole, has created another problem. Because historically most Departments of Non-formal Education in Asia and the Pacific have been concerned mainly with Equivalency Programmes, there has been a tendency neglect other types of life-long learning. It is vitally important for Member States to broaden their concept of continuing education to involve the many objectives and approaches advocated hi these volumes, and especially to promote informal education. A more helpful approach would be to identify Departments of Continuing Education which would have equivalency type programmes as only one of their responsibilities. The problem in terminology partly arises because of the traditionally narrow definition of «education» as meaning formal education alone. This narrow view has also resulted in an over emphasis on formal schooling and the relative neglect of non-formal and self learning approaches. This imbalance has created many problems and in most developing countries formal schooling has not lived up to its expectations as the main mechanism far socio-economic development. Formal education tends to be selective. elitist, academic in orientation and largely irrelevant to real needs. Because traditional formal education is urban in orientation it has encouraged a drift to the cities and there has been a denial of the best traditional values. Also in spite of the fact that for most people formal education represents only about 20 per cent of lifelong education, it absorbs more than 90 per cent of the educational budget. Member States are now recognizing that socio-economic planning alone is not enough and that human resource development is a key enabling factor in development. Human resource development is viewed by UNDP as «the process of enlarging peoples choices». People should lead long and healthy lives, be well educated and have access to resources needed for a decent standard of living. UNDP has now created a new «development index» an Index of Human Development (the HDI) to go together with the traditional index of Gross National Product 4 (GNP). Countries can now be classified as having low, medium or high HDI. The indicators for HDI include life expectancy, adult literacy level and purchasing power. This new index focuses on how human wellbeing translates into economic growth and vice versa. What has not yet been fully appreciated however by many Member States is that human resource development and lifelong learning are the same thing. What is urgently needed now is a broader view of education that has formal schooling as only a small component of life planning and that even the provision of equivalency programmes is not enough. Since continuing education is the opportunity to engage in lifelong learning, continuing education must now emerge as the main component of this broader view of education as a whole. (see figure 1.2). N A R R O W V I E W OFEDUCATION Figure 1.2: A Changing View of Education Continuing education programmes provide an opportunity for all citizens to truly integrate learning, working and living. These three aspects of personal development must grow together so that overdo quality of life improves and so that society as a whole becomes truly an «educated» society in the best meaning of the term. D. Types of Continuing Education Programmes Apart from defining continuing education the UNESCO Seminar «Continuing Education in the Context of APPEAL» held in Cangerra, Australia, in November 1987 devised a system of classifying types of continuing education programmes into six categories according to their aims. This classification was slightly amended at the First Meeting for Regional Co-ordination of APPEAL held in Bangkok, Thailand, 14-18 November 1988.1 The definitions expressed in terms of programme aims, have been further refined in the various UNESCO workshops which drafted the volumes in the ATLP-CE series. l See Final Report of this meeting published by UNESCO/PROAP, Bangkok in 1989, page 27. 5 BROAD VIEWOFEDUCATION SCHOOLINGALONE A SMALL PART OFLIFE CHANGES SCHOOLING ASONLY TO ONEOPTIONAMONGMANY LIFELONGLEARNING The six types of continuing education programmes are listed and defined below (see box). TYPE 1 POST-LITERACY PROGRAMMES (PLPs). These aim to maintain and enhance basic literacy, numeracy and problem solving skills, giving individuals sufficient general basic work skills enabling them to function effectively in their societies. TYPE 2 EQUIVALENCY PROGRAMMES (EPs). These are designed as alternative education programmes equivalent to existing formal general or vocational education.TYPE 3 I N C O M E G E N E R ATING PROGRAMMES (IGPs). These help participants acquires or upgrade vocational skills and enable them to conduct incomegenerating activities. IGPs are those vocational continuing education programmes delivered in a variety of contexts and which are directed in particular towards those people who are currently not self-sufficient in a modern world, that is those persons at or below the poverty line. TYPE 4 Q U A L I T Y O F LIFE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMMES (QLIPs). These aim to equip learners and the community with that essential knowledge, attitudes, values and skills to enable them to improve quality of life as individuals and as members of the community.TYPE 5 I N D I V I D U A L I N T E R E S T PROMOTION PROGRAMMES (IIPs). These provide opportunity for individuals to participate in and learn about their chosen social. cultural, spiritual, health, physical and artistic interests. TYPE 6 FUTURE ORIENTED (FOs) PROGRAMMES. These give workers, professionals, regional and national community leaders, villagers, businessmen and planners new skills, knowledge and techniques to adapt themselves and their organisations to growing social and technological changes. Volumes II to VII of ATLP-CE deal with each of these types in turn. It is recommend that all readers study volume I on General Principles of Continuing Education and Volume VIII on Learning Centres together with the one or more specialised volumes II to VII of particular relevance to their interests and responsibilities. It should be stressed, however, that the volumes provide only broad principles and guidelines and have dealt with each type of continuing education programme separately in order to clarify concepts and objectives in these various areas. In practice. continuing education programmes currently operating in most Member States, generally combine several of these approaches. For example many post-literacy programmes are also equivalency programmes and both usually include some aspects of income generation. 6 E. Sorting out the Terms: Educational Concepts, Systems, Processes and Programmes Terminology in the area of continuing education is somewhat confused because thinking in this relatively new area is still somewhat flexible and open to several interpretations. It may be helpful to think of relevant terms under four headings: «concepts», «systems»; «processes» and «Programmes». By «concept» is mean a general idea or notion; by «system» is meant on organized body of connected things or parts such as the structured system of education offered by a government ministry and by «process», is meant a method of operation or a state of carrying on a procedure. By «programme» is meant a structured series of learning events designed to achieve specified outcomes.By way of summary, therefore, the key definitions in the area of continuing education are as follows: 1. Concepts The key concept is of a learning society. In a learning society all agencies and adult individuals are educational providers. All Member Sates are striving to achieve this goal. 2. Systems These include the formal, non-formal and self-learning educational systems and all three contribute to life-long learning. 3. Processes The process central to the concept of a learning society is life-long learning which involves taking full advantage of the educational opportunities provided by the learning society. The term continuing education refers to the processes of providing such opportunities. 4. Programmes The process of continuing education can be implemented by several types of structured experiences or programmes such as post-literacy programmes, equivalency programmes, income-generating programmes, quality of life improvement programmes, individual interest promotion programmes and future oriented programmes. 7 F. Continuing Education and Development Continuing Education is as essential extension of literacy and primary education to promote human resource development. Because of the vast number of variables involved and because of the complexity of their interactions it is not possible to prove that increased education causes increased socio-economic development. Logically, however, it is reasonable to infer that increases in knowledge and skill are needed for the introduction and expansion of modern technology and that education must grow and change if a technologically based socio-economic system is to grow and change. Education seen in this way is an enabling agent for development. Socio-economic growth is of course the main thrust of most development plans in the Third World and most policies are directed at strengthening formal education to ensure that there is adequate knowledge and skill to enable development to occur. Unfortunately, however, this policy has largely failed and social and economic inequalities, low productivity and high levels of illiteracy and semiliteracy remain. Many graduates from formal schooling are unemployed and unemployable and because the formal educational system is largely urban in its orientation there has been a massive population shift from rural areas to cities. Schooling in some countries has in fact so alienated some people from the mainstream of society that social systems have tended to break down and conflict and aggression have become commonplace. This crisis in education in the Third World has come about largely because the formal system caters only for a handful of successful students and the rest become alienated and unproductive. Continuing education, that is the opportunity to engage in lifelong learning, therefore emerges as a way of compensating for the inadequacies of the formal system by giving people a second chance, and also of ensuring a continual growth and upgrading of human resources throughout the lives of all citizens. Human resource development (HRD) becomes the focus of attention. Appropriately educated people develop positive attitudes and skills, can improve the quality of their work and can increase their incomes. People can save and invest and a general upgrading of the socio-economic structure of society occurs based on the emergence of secure, happy and prosperous individuals and families. With such improved human resources and in particular because of both a stronger domestic economy and an improved quality of the human mind, the third world would be better able to manage its scarce national resources and so ensure effective, appropriate and sustainable development. These ideas are illustrated in figure 1.3.8 A focus on human resource development through continuing education has another important implication for overall socio-economic development. Most development theorists argue that education alone is not enough to ensure that development will occur. They state that unemployment, illiteracy and social inequality are caused by structural aspects of society which education alone cannot address. Some extremists, usually those following Marxist ideology, would even argue that schooling is deliberately imposed in such a way that structural reforms cannot occur and that the system ensures dependency of the majority who are poor and disadvantaged on the few who are wealthy and powerful. In advancing these arguments, however, such theorists usually have only formal education in mind. Continuing education, that is the provision for lifelong learning, does two things to overcome this problem. Firstly it equips individuals with the mental abilities and practical skills necessary to address structural weaknesses in society. Secondly, and perhaps even more significantly, it changes the emphasis from something «imposed from above», such as a formal system of institutionalised education, to something self initiated and self sustained by individual learners. In continuing education it is the individuals who set and pursue their learning objectives, not the system. Continuing education, therefore, not only equips people to bring about structural changes hi society; it empowers them to do so. If continuing education promotes the growth of human resources and leads to significant socio-economic gains, the question emerges what sort of socio-economic development should it generate? Human resource development in some countries is seen to be synonymous with manpower development the production of an educated work force, and the build up of «human capital». Others see it more in terms of an overall improved quality of life involving all dimension’s of personal growth. Another issue is that human resource development in some countries is dealt with sectorally in different planning documents and is implemented by several, frequently competing agencies. There is an absence of co-ordinated action. If continuing education is seen as the mechanism for human resource development these types of issues can be more readily addressed. If there is a well organized and co-ordinated infrastructure for continuing education, and if continuing education policies are based on national planning, then all aspects of human resource development can be systematically advanced. There is another important aspect. As more people become involved in lifelong learning and improve their educational standards and ways of life, more will be involved in social decision making at all levels. Development plans will come to reflect what people want and need based on their reasoned understanding of potentials and limitations. In this way a truly sustainable development is likely to emerge. In other words, development will reflect the concerns of the people and will be fair to both the present and the future. It is more likely to leave future generations at least a similar, but hopefully better, endowment of resources than at present. 10 G. Conclusion Continuing education has been defined in this chapter as an opportunity to pursue lifelong learning after the completion of primary education or its equivalent. It has been argued that it is the mechanism for human resource development which in turn is the basis of meaningful sustainable socio-economic development. These arguments, if accepted, give continuing education a key role in society. Indeed since formal education alone is now seen to be insufficient and inadequate as the enabling force for development, viable alternatives are needed. Continuing education offers countries an opportunity to face and solve their social and economic problems and to grow and develop according to a meaningful and effective plan. 11 Chapter 2 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORMAL EDUCATION AND CONTINUING EDUCATION A. Formal Education as a Component Of Continuing Education In the previous chapter formal education, non-formal education and informal education were described as subsets of continuing education (Figure 1.2), and continuing education was defined as the provision of opportunity for lifelong learning after primary schooling. Adults engaged in continuing education are largely self motivated and establish their own learning agendas. Since continuing education draws on education, wherever it is available, no matter by whom it is provided, it is clear that programmes provided by formal education institutions are only one of many sources and options. Some people may wish to continue for some years in formal education following straight on from primary school. Others may wish to seek education from alternative sources such as non-formal equivalency programmes but return to formal education later. Some even may follow formal units of education quite late in lifeeven after retirement. Most people, however tend to rely more and more on the informal system as they become older. Any system of continuing education therefore, should ensure that a wide variety of agencies and modalities is available in all localities and that these provide as broad a range of activities as possible. B. The Issue of Complementarity The various subsectors or systems of continuing education formal, non-formal and self learning do not stand alone. They are complementary in two ways. In the first place during the progression of any one persons life, he or she draws on all three subsectors as required for completing individual learning tasks. In this way all three are integrated into an individual’s personal development programme and so each contributes to the lifelong «curriculum» of the individual.In the second place each type of continuing education provider helps and supports other providers. Ideally all providers should be part of a network which should be administered so as to avoid costly redundancies, overlapping provision or inappropriate or ineffective programmes and activities. Each provider in the network should be aware of the work of providers in similar fields and each should complement the work of the others. As agreed by a UNESCO workshop in 1985 complementary means «mutual support between the formal and other systems of education in respect of mobilisation and utilisation of physical facilities, personnel, administrative structure, 13 curriculum and instruction materials, training of teachers and supervisors and evaluation certification procedure and techniques that have developed within formal, and non-formal education».1 C. Differences between Formal Education and Other Subsectors of Continuing Education While formal education is likely to remain an important component of lifelong learning for at least the foreseeable future, it is the non-formal and informal systems which make up most of the learning experiences of adults. It is important, therefore to appreciate the key differences between formal education on one hand and of the remaining components in the other. Table 2.1: Some differences between formal education and the other two systems of Continuing Education2 No. Criterion Formal Education Non-formal Education and Self Learning 1. Objective To acquire lifelong skills and to obtain a certificate 1 Coordination and Complementarity. Bangkok, UNESCO 1985. 2 Based on a table given by Hussain, Mohd. Hoesne in a paper «Non-formal Education as a Complementary Strategy to Human Resource Development» presented during the UNESCO/ PROAP Planning Meeting for Literacy Personnel Training Activities for 1990, Hua Hin, Thailand, 16-23 April 1990, p.8. 14 To acquire skills for immediate use. 2. Time-frame It takes a long time to obtain the certificates and it involves full-time concentration. Short and intermittent. 3. Curriculum Academic in approach Unacademic but it suits the needs of the target groups/ functionnal. 4. Methodology Institutional with authoritarian teacher/student relationship Flexible. Adult oriented. Stress on independent learning. 5. Control Top down relationship Flexible. depending on situation, but largely self initiated. Each individual learner will call on the resources of both types of system throughout lifelong learning but commitment to formal education is usually more difficult in terms of time and effort, is frequently off target and is usually expensive. It is not surprising therefore, that the proportion of time spent in formal education by almost all adults is considerably less than for the other approaches to continuing education. This point is another strong argument why educational ministries should give at least as much support for the non-formal and informal aspects of continuing education as for the formal system. Arlen Wayne Etling in his book Characteristics of Facilitators the Ecuador Project and Beyond3 has elaborated six dimensions of education outside of the formal system. They are: a) learner centred b) cafeteria curriculum c) horizontal relationship d) reliance on local resources e) immediate usefulness f) low level of structure Each of these dimensions is briefly described below from the perspective of continuing education.(a) Learner-Centred. In non-formal and informal education the learning is initiated and controlled by the learner. Learners create their own learning environment rather than have it imposed from above or from outside. The learner either defines his or her own learning objectives or participates in formulating them. (b) Cafeteria Curriculum. The curriculum is flexible and open to negotiation. It is determined by the choice of the learner and is not prescribed or required by someone else and may not always even be sequential. (c) Horizontal Relationship. Educators become facilitators rather than teachers. The relationship between «facilitator» and «learner» is friendly and informal and the learner views the facilitator as a resource rather than as an instructor. Facilitators may come from the formal subsector but have changed roles in non formal and informal education. Some facilitators may be members of a group of learners who have leadership ability or some special skill or knowledge to be shared with others. 3 Quoted by Hussain, M.H. Ibid p.8 15 (d) Reliance on Local Resources. In most developing countries resources for all forms of education, including non-formal programmes and informal learning, are scarce. Inexpensive alternatives and use of local resources therefore becomes essential. (e) Immediate Usefulness. Non-formal and informal approaches stress functional learning of immediate and direct relevance to the lives of learners. As contrasted to formal education, even formal education selected by an individual as part of his or her lifelong learning path non-formal and informal learning involves immediate action and direct application of what has been learnt. The pay-off is tangible and direct and increases in material well being. Outside the formal system activities tend to be short with a «present time» not «future time» orientation. Non-formal and informal approaches are superior forms of continuing education where the object is to change immediate action or initiate new action. (f) Low level of Structure. Outside of formal education learning activities are diverse and flexible and this implies there should be a diversity of structure. From a systems point of view some provision for continuing education appears uncoordinated, fragmented and diffuse. From an individual learners point of view such fragmentation does not matter in terms of developing and catering for his or her lifelong learning plan. In fact the more diverse the situation the more options are available and the greater the likelihood of finding activities which fit the learning plan. What matters is that the learner (i) has an easy way of finding out what is available and (ii) has ready access to the activities, and (iii) can initiate his or her own learning activities. This implies that some planning is needed and as stressed in Section B all providers should be part of a network and should aim for complementarity. D. The Disjunction between Formal Education and Other Systems of Continuing Education A review of the issues raised in Section C makes it fairly clear that formal education within continuing education may not always be as appropriate as either the non-formal or informal approaches. This is for three reasons: (i) for most adults formal units of education make up only small segments of the lifelong learning plan, and then generally only when people are relatively young (ii) the methods of formal education are not always appropriate for adult learners and (iii) the objectives set by teachers in the formal system rarely exactly match the objectives set by individual learners to meet their own needs. In many formal education programmes the «match» between the learner and the course offered is minimal. In extreme cases teachers take the view that the learners are there to serve the subject, not the subject to serve the learners. For them the structure and «beauty» of the subject is all that matters since the subject matter has educational viability in its own right. Physics teachers, for example, frequently argue that it is the beauty and elegance of physical theory which matters and its relevance to life and applications in work are incidental. These views tend to become more prominent in higher levels of formal education and reach their extremes in many university programmes. 16 For these reasons it is not surprising that many adults find it difficult to insert units of formal education into their unfolding lifelong learning plan especially later in life. The question arises what can be done to moderate this disjunction? Malcolm Knowles, the well-known American continuing educationist, takes the extreme view that formal education should be abandoned altogether, at least in its present form, and be totally integrated into a system of delivery for planned lifelong learning (see Chapter 5). There have been others before him such as Ivan Illich who have advocated the «deschooling» of society4. While there are strong arguments in favour of this extreme view it is unlikely to come about in the foreseeable future, at least in the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific. The type of action which could and perhaps should be pursued now would be to change the emphasis on formal education so that it is seen to be an integral part of lifelong learning. This would mean that at primary school pupils should not only learn, but also learn how to learn and be given the impetus and motivation to continue to learn as they get older. At secondary school level the curriculum should be more open and the methods of teaching more flexible and individually oriented. Secondary schools should find out more about what people need and respond to those needs. But probably the most significant reform should be that all formal educational institutions should be an integral part of the infrastructure for continuing education and should not stand aside as at present. Certainly they should be part of any continuing education network which may be established (see Chapter 5). Ideally they should be accessed through a system of learning centres of the type proposed by Malcolm Knowles (Chapter 5). As a first step, perhaps, the material and human resources «locked up» in formal institutions should be more flexibly employed to meet the lifelong educational needs of the community as a whole. 4 Illich, Ivan Deschooling Society New York: Harper and Row, 1974. 17 Chapter 3 THE PRESENT STATUS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION A. Introduction The aim of ATLP-CE is to assist Member States to develop or strengthen their systems of continuing education. At present the levels of development and the approaches taken from country to country are highly varied. Overall there appears to be three main areas of concern: (i) the need to strengthen continuing education as an agency for life-long learning beyond the level of primary education or its equivalent; (ii) the need to relate continuing education to socioeconomic development through the promotion of human resource development, and (iii) the need to develop a systematic approach to the management and delivery of continuing education while retaining its necessary diversity, flexibility and local control. This chapter briefly reviews the present status and management of continuing education in ten selected countries. B. Continuing Education in Ten Selected Countries The ten countries selected for review are mainly from Asia and the Pacific but some from other Regions (Europe and Africa) have been included for comparison. The countries are at various stages of socio-economic development. Some (e.g. Australia, U.K.) are developed nations; others are at intermediate but rapidly improving stages of development (e.g. Philippines and Thailand3 and others are underdeveloped (e.g. Mali). The levels of development and the approaches taken in continuing education from country to country have certain elements of similarity but the situation is actually quite varied, and is strongly related to the stage of development of each country and to the pattern of its general educational system. The outlines provided below are based on the following sources: i) Reference documents for the UNESCO PROAP Planning Meeting for Literacy Personnel Training Activities of 1990, Hua Hin, Thailand, 16-33 April 1990. ii) Country papers presented at the above meeting. iii) The publication «Continuing Education in Asia and the Pacific» Bulletin of the UNESCO Principal Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific No. 28 September 1987. iv) The publication «Adult Education in Thailand» in Adult Education and Development No. 33 September 1989 published by the German Adult Education 19 Association for the World Conference on Education for All. v) Country reports given at recent UNESCO workshops and meetings on postliteracy and continuing education in Asia and the Pacific and elsewhere. (a) AUSTRALIA Continuing education, while well established, is not nationally co-ordinated and there are independent and varied initiatives by the various states and territories. Throughout the country, however, much of noncredit adult education has been conducted by higher education institutions such as universities, colleges, teacher education institutions and technical and further education colleges, and also by local community centres. In most states there are Boards of Adult Education, or Departments of Community Services or their equivalent which promote a wide range of learning activities for adults. In addition to the programmes offered by tertiary institutions these Boards promote activities through a network of adult education evening colleges. Most frequently these colleges utilize the resources of a local primary school after school hours. Many other agencies are involved in continuing education and while they usually have established co-ordination links with the relevant State Board, that is by no means always the case. These agencies include community learning centres, artistic and cultural bodies, sporting groups, social clubs, museums, art galleries, craft societies, libraries, zoos and botanical gardens, local history groups, local government agencies, national parks and wildlife centres and many agencies within the business and commercial community. It would seem, however, that most State Governments have yet to recognize that in value-for-money terms, adult and continuing education represent the best available value. Further, community education has become a major vehicle for women to grow and develop and explore new personal directions within a responsive environment and governments need to further strengthen that aspect. In Australia, at least until now (1993), continuing education has beep equated with adult education and the relationships between formal, non-formal and informal education in lifelong learning have not been fully appreciated. There has also been a failure at the national level to appreciate the human resource development aspects of continuing education. While Australia is now, in many respects, a learning society, the focus of learning is not on the socio-economic needs of the nation as a whole. (b) INDIA A statement entitled «Adult and Continuing Education» was included hi the National Policy on Education in 1986. This advocated: (i) establishment of learning centres in rural areas 20 for continuing education; (ii) worker’s education; (iii) programmes of distance education based on a self-learning approach; (iv) need and interest based vocational training; and (v) programmes to promote the wider use of books libraries and reading centres. Libraries and reading rooms of formal educational institutions are open to the public in the evenings and necessary financial support is available for this function. Voluntary efforts to establish reading rooms and libraries are encouraged. Since 1988 a major government initiative has been to establish Jana Shikshan Nilayams (Centres for Continuing Education) (JSNs) throughout the country as the core of an infrastructure for continuing education. These are learning centres which bring together programmes originally organized as part of farmer’s twining programmes, youth clubs, the mobile and village library system and rural reading rooms. Even more recently (post 1992) under a new strategy for Teaching Learning Centres, the JSNs are only one form of centre providing post-literacy and other types of continuing education. More recently established centres are volunteer-based and as in the first phase of the campaign for basic literacy have multiple objectives. These involve remediation, upgrading of competencies, and retention and application of basic literacy skills. (c) INDONESIA In Indonesia the formal educational system is more closely integrated into continuing education and out-of-school programmes provide equivalency courses by alternative means for both primary education (Paket A) and junior secondary education (Paket B). It is also proposed to develop an alternative equivalent for Senior High School (Paket C). Indonesia therefore defines continuing education very broadly and consistently with the definition promoted under ATLP-CE. Continuing Education is defined as «educational programmes after basic education has been attained» i.e. in-school education at junior high, senior high and university levels; out of school alternatives (Pakets A, B and C); skill-formation programmes such as income generating groups, apprenticeships; upgrading courses and family education programmes at home. An important aspect for Indonesia is that the relationship between continuing education and lifelong learning is appreciated and the central aim is to promote the development of a learning society. A weakness before 1987 was that while many agencies, mainly government departments, were effective providers, there was no National Co-ordinating Commission for Continuing Education and policies were not fully co-ordinated. But after 1987, when the APPEAL Indonesia was created, national co-ordination of efforts has been achieved. Agencies involved in continuing education in Indonesia and the types of programmes offered are listed below: 21 Agency Ministry of Education and Culture (MOE) in Cooperation with other Ministries MOE with the Ministry of Manpower MOE alone Indonesian Scout Movement Ministry of Agriculture Family Life Welfare Movement Family Planning Coordination Board National Sports Committee Office of the Minister of Role of Women Ministry of Information Programme Income Generating Learning Groups Vocational courses Apprenticeship training Pakets A, B and C Scout leaders training Farmers learning groups Learning groups on Peoples Plantations Family Life Education Courses Family Planning Groups Sports training Training Sports Club Leaders Income-generating groups for women TV and radio learning group broadcasts (d) JAPAN In Japan continuing education is well established and is defined as the mechanism for developing a learning society. Constantly with ATLP-CE continuing education is perceived as proceeding after basic education has been attained, that is it is for literate adults (including youth). Because of the strength and success of formal education in Japan there is little need for basic literacy programmes or catch-up equivalency programmes through a non formal system. What is emphasised is vocational education; cultural activities, especially for women and the aged; and physical recreation. These types of programmes are popular with people of all ages. The library and museum movements in Japan are especially well developed and libraries and museums are important agencies for continuing education. The total number of public libraries in Japan in 1983 was 1, 644 with a staff of 13,145 trained personnel. There were 676 public museums staffed by 10,368 appropriately trained personnel. 22 The Japanese government directly provides the following types of activities outside the formal education system: social correspondence education; specialized training schools; skill examinations; vocational training; university extension courses; university of the air; educational broadcasting and information services and projects. Private enterprise, especially the manufacturing and business communities, are also heavily involved in continuing education through the provision of in-house training and by working with the general public. (e) MALI In 1967 a nation-wide functional literacy programme was launched in the framework of the «Experimental World Literacy Programme». This programme consisted of three cycles (i) literacy; (ii) post-literacy and (iii) lifelong education. The programme continues and views education as a key mechanism of social and economic development. Continuing Education is seen to be for adults outside of formal education. The activities under the programme are initiated by several types of agencies and many, especially in the post-literacy area, arise spontaneously or are initiated by local authorities. The programmes are relatively unstructured and uncoordinated. The main thrust is the production of reading and extension materials, but these are produced by a wide variety of organizations, both government and non-government. Most focus on specific projects such as groundnuts and food cultivation; rice growing in specific regions; high valley projects; livestock keeping; fishing and cooperative movements. Specific materials are also produced by the national offices of Cooperation, Health, and Waterways and Forests. Another important facet of continuing education is the Rural Press. A newspaper «Kibaru» was founded in 1972 with the aim of promoting reading, and of preventing literacy regression and of developing skill development. It’s Editorial Board is representative of various agencies such as the Ministry of Information, The Press and Publications Agency; Functional Literacy Department; Institute of Rural Affairs; Health Education; Office of Waterways and Forests and the National Directorate of Cooperation. Educational broadcasts are also promoted and focus on aspects of rural development. Activities are coordinated by the Educational Radio Service and call on the services of all agricultural development organisations. There is also a special government programme to provide more advanced education for neoliterates. Training courses are provided for newly literate peasants to help them understand and apply new scientific knowledge and technological innovations relevant to their lives. (f) PHILIPPINES Continuing education is defined as the provision of opportunities for lifelong learning beyond basic literacy and primary education, including formal education beyond these levels. 23 Nevertheless those aspects of continuing education outside the formal education system are administered by a separate Bureau of Non-Formal (Continuing) Education within the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports. The link between education and development is appreciated in the Philippines and the government has promoted education to raise the general standard of living, to provide opportunity for youth and adults to acquire marketable skills and to improve the general quality of life. Currently (1990) the Government is encouraging closer co-operation and complementarity between non formal and formal education and there is a good working relationship among the many agencies involved in formal and non formal programmes. Nongovernment agencies are also active in continuing education and most cooperate with relevant government agencies. The main government agency is the Bureau of Non-formal Education which provides (i) a range of programmes for out-of-school youth (ii) post-literacy work for adults (iii) training in livelihood skills (iv) self-help and self-reliance programmes and (v) education in values. Training of continuing education personnel is seen to be an important aspect. In 1986 the Bureau of Non-Formal Education initiated a National Training Programme for multidisciplinary educational personnel in the rural areas to facilitate the planning, implementation and evaluation of continuing education activities in the context of rural development. (g) TANZANIA Continuing education is the responsibility of the Adult Education Directorate of the Ministry of National Education. There is a well organized infrastructure consisting of (i) regional adult education co-ordinators (ii) district adult education co-ordinators (iii) divisional education officers and (iv) ward officers. At each level there is an Adult Education Committee and membership is representative of relevant agencies such as Ministries of Health, Labour and Social Welfare and the Prime Ministers Office. A co-ordination system links all levels to ensure maximum participation and to reduce redundancy. The system is seen to lie outside of the formal education network and caters for literate adults beyond primary school grade. The main thrust is the establishment of simple village libraries or reading centres (in about 8,000 villages by the mid 1970s). These provide various types of books and other reading materials in a graded postliteracy series. They build on the skills of adults who have attained literacy through their participation in national functional literacy programmes. The centres are also supported by a library service which provides mobile book boxes on a rotation basis. The training of personnel for continuing education is seen to be especially important. Two-week orientation courses on library techniques and one-week refresher courses are provided each year for district, ward and village leaders and librarians in charge of the reading centres. 24 (h) THAILAND Continuing education is seen to be the mechanism for lifelong learning and to cater for all those literate youths and adults beyond the level of primary schooling. The term «non-formal» however, is used not just for catch up equivalency programmes but for all forms of adult education outside of the formal system. Continuing education is administered by the Ministry of Education Department of Non-Formal Education (NFE) which was created in 1979 by merging the previous Divisions of Adult Education, the Centre for Educational Museums and the Centre for Educational Technology. Its responsibilities, apart from basic adult literacy, include (i) compensatory education for the disadvantaged (ii) short courses in skills training (iii) reading promotion (iv) educational museums and (v) education through the mass media. The NFE Department also has a co-ordinating role promoting links with other relevant agencies and is also responsible for research, planning and development in continuing education. It has a major role in training continuing education personnel for all levels and programmes of the system. It also facilitates the work of other continuing education agencies through the provision of subsidies and general services. There is a well developed infrastructure under the Department of NFE. Under the central office in Bangkok there are four regional R & D Centres and in each province there is a central Lifelong Education Centre providing a variety of programmes in post-literacy, income generation, educational equivalency and quality of life improvement. At the local level there is a network of village learning centres, encouraged and supported by Provincial Lifelong Education Centres. The village centres are managed by the villagers themselves and have reading centres, basic educational facilitates, resources for social activities and community meeting halls. Equivalency programmes comparable to formal school grades 6, 9 and 12 are offered by NFE in three alternative modes (i) classroom situations (ii) radio correspondence and (iii) self instruction. An information service is provided through (i) a network of public libraries (ii) village reading centres (iii) radio and TV programmes for schools and adult classes and (iv) museum education. The NFE Department also produces educational films and other audio-visual resources. In the area of skills training, attention focuses mainly on industry, home economics, business and agriculture and is provided by three types of activities: (i) vocational classes in day schools; (ii) mobile vocational classes in rural areas and (iii) interest groups, mainly in rural areas. (I) UNITED KINGDOM The United Kingdom is essentially a learning society but as in Australia this situation has evolved unsystematically over many decades (indeed in U.K. over many centuries). It is therefore uncoordinated and highly decentralised. There is an almost infinite range of opportunity for adult learning in almost any area of knowledge provided by a multiplicity of both government and non-government agencies. Because of this complexity these notes focus on only one aspect i.e. the newly emerging post-literacy programmes. 25 The need for post-literacy programmes arose as it became clear that the population included an unacceptably large number of semiliterate adults. Programmes to raise literacy levels emerged in the 1980s as a result of informed dialogue between local organizers and adult educators on the one hand, and consultant advisers of central agencies on the other. Agencies responsible for promoting post-literacy activities are the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit (ALBSU), the National Institute of Adult Education in England and Wales (NIAE), and the Scottish Adult Basic Education Unit (SCABU). The infrastructure is very loose and unstructured with an emphasis on local effort. At central level there is a Government National Advisory Council for Adult and Continuing Education (ACACE) which has links with the National Institute of Adult Education. There is little central ministerial control of curriculum or methodology. Other agencies cooperate in the work of the ACACE including the Manpower Services Commission, the Open University and the British Broadcasting Cooperation. Training of CE personnel is provided centrally by the ACACE and centrally trained trainers and activists train others at district and local level. Further training opportunities for adult workers are provided under a training opportunities scheme sponsored by the Manpower Service Commission. An important outlet for post-literacy work is provided by the nationwide library service which has an extension service of motorised traveling libraries for remote villages. Librarians work closely with adult educators and have links with the broadcast media, especially radio. Library personnel working with adult educators also conduct door-to-door contact campaigns. (I) VIETNAM Up until 1990 the Government had given high priority to the eradication of illiteracy because of conviction that ability to read and write awakens consciousness and stimulates participation in political action. Eradication of illiteracy therefore, was seen as the first step in the process of raising cultural standards. The Government, however, is now ready to develop a system of continuing education. As a beginning a good start has been made on programmes of complementary education offered to literate adults. These provide essential knowledge and skill for all types of workers with the aims of increasing productivity and of enabling the workforce to utilize modern techniques and equipment. Another aspect of continuing education in Vietnam is the provision of «specific topic» non-formal education for farmers. Topics include rice growing, hog-breeding, birth control, improving cooking facilites and similar functional topics. About thirty topics are covered each year and each topic involves one to three sessions of 1 1/2 2 hours duration. Continuing education schools and classes are also provided for ethnic minorities in language and as part of the complementary education system (second level equivalency). C. Trends and Issues The following general trends and issues emerge firm the country situations outlined above. 26 a) Most Member States in the sample view continuing education as the provision of opportunity for lifelong learning beyond basic literacy and primary education. b) There are some differences in regard to defining the scope of continuing education. Most see it as including formal, non formal and informal education but a minority view it as something outside of and beyond formal education. c) The role of continuing education as a mechanism for socio-economic development is appreciated by most. Continuing education as human resource development (HRD) and the relationship between HRD and socio-economic development, however, is not usually stated clearly. This is reflected in the absence of strong linkages between national socio-economic planning and continuing education policy. d) Objectives of continuing education are usually expressed or implied as improvement in quality of life and living standards of all citizens. e) There is a wide range of target clientele for continuing education but in most countries the emphasis is on rural communities, disadvantaged groups, neoliterates and semiliterates and those needing training in vocational and income-generating skills. The types of activities frequently include the following: i) Vocational/technical courses, apprenticeship programmes. ii) Income-generating activities iii) Extension and equivalency education iv) Arts and culture v) Specific learning programmes such as farmer education, population/family life education, health and nutrition programmes, and so on vi) Rural libraries and reading centres promoting post-literacy skills vii) Self-reliance programmes. f) Linkages and networking are strong in some countries and relatively weak in others. On the whole infrastructure is partial only in that, where present at all, it mainly caters for and co-ordinates government initiatives alone. In most cases (there are exceptions) the infrastructure does not adequately involve nongovernment providers. g) Several countries lack National Policy Boards or Co-ordination Agencies. In some, even government initiatives in CE are uncoordinated and are the responsibility of a variety of ministries and departments which pursue more or less independent programmes. It would seem that some instrumentalities (e.g. Health, Agriculture) whose primary function is outside education, do not perceive themselves as educational agencies and therefore tend to stand aside from educational networks. 27 h) Only few countries have recognized that lifelong learning is the initiative of each individual and that individuals determine their learning objectives throughout life and need access to all forms of formal, non-formal and informal educationnal opportunities to achieve these objectives. Almost all reports on which the above country summaries were based were government and provider centred, not learner centred. This is why in most countries the formal educational system is seen to be something apart and not just one component of continuing education. i) While several countries (e.g. India, Tanzania, Thailand, United Kingdom) have appreciated the need for clearly defined contact or entry points for individuals to engage in the system, some have not. The role of local learning centres in this regard has been highlighted in some countries but not in others. j) The training of a cadre of professional continuing educators to encourage and help all types of providers and to administer a systematic delivery system is appreciated by most countries in the sample. Some countries, however, have still to address this issue. k) there are varying attitudes to decentralization and local management and control. In some countries CE is seen clearly to be a «grass roots» matter under the control of local people. In others it is seen mainly as an instrument of government and is controlled and administered centrally. l) The relationship between literacy and continuing education is clearly perceived by all Member States. Countries which in the past, have had to focus mainly on the eradication of illiteracy, are now able to change their priorities and to begin and/or strengthen continuing education to consolidate and build on literacy achievements. m) Almost all countries see the promotion of the reading habit and the provision of appropriate reading materials as a central responsibility for continuing education. Mechanisms for achieving this (e.g. libraries, reading centres, book-mobiles, postliteracy workshop and so on) vary from country to country. D. Conclusion Fundamentally, there appears to be an underlying weakness common to almost all systems of continuing education reviewed in this chapter. It is essentially that CE policies are not adequately integrated with national dvelopment policy and as a result few governments seem to quite know what CE is for; how it should be administered and what should be its outcomes and contributions to personal and national well-being. This problem in turn causes other problems. The most serious of these is that in even the most efficient and well organized approaches there is at best only a partial infrastructure for organizing, administering, promoting and evaluating continuing education as a system. ATLP-CE offers an exemplar of a systematic approach to the organization of CE hopefully without inhibiting its necessary diversity and creative individuality. This approach is described and briefly discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. 28 Chapter 4 ATLP-CE: ITS ORIGIN, SCOPE AND DEVELOPMENT A. Origin of ATLP-CE Under APPEAL UNESCO PROAP has developed a set of materials and a system of training for literacy personnel in Asia and the Pacific ATLP. The training programme provides guidelines for developing a literacy training curriculum, for designing and producing training materials and for establishing a training infrastructure. A systems approach has been adopted for all aspects from macro to micro levels. By macro level is meant the development of a national literacy training policy and system and by microlevel is meant the design, production and use of training materials and of specific training activities using a systematic INPUT-PROCESSOUTPUT model 1. During 1988 and 1989 twelve volumes for ATLP were produced by UNESCO PROAP, Bangkok and Regional, Sub-Regional and National Workshops have been held to familiarize literacy workers with these materials and to train them in their application. The titles of the volumes are shown below (Figure 4.1). The materials were produced with three levels of personnel in mind as shown in the triangular diagram (Figure 4.2). 1 Principles-of Curriculum Design for Literacy Training All 2 Principles of Resource Design for Literacy Training All 3 Manual for Senior Administrators of Literacy Training Programmes A 4 Manual for Supervisors Resource Development and Training Procedures B 5 Exemplar Training Manual Extra Money for the Family C 6 Exemplar Training Manual Our Forests C 7 Exemplar Training Manual Village Co-operative C 8 Exemplar Training Manual Health Services C 9 Specifications for Additional Exemplar Training Manuals C and B 10 Post-Literacy Activities and Continuing Education A and B 11 Evaluating a Literacy Training Programme A and B 12 Implementing a Literacy Training Programme All 1 Meyer G.

Senior Management Provincial/district Supervisors (including trainers of trainers) Instructors and Trainers (Teachers) Level A Level B Level C Figure 4.2 Three levels of literacy trainig personnel catered for by ATLP 30 ATLP, however, is designed to help Member States achieve universal literacy by the year 2000 or soon after and therefore should be seen only as an interim programme. ATLP however, has promoted the development of a systematic infrastructure and well trained personnel for literacy development which with some amendment and adaptation could provide an overall framework for continuing education. The majority of Member States of Asia and the Pacific are now implementing continuing education programmes or are ready to begin work in this area. As literacy becomes universal the ideal of lifelong learning and the evolution of a learning society become real possibilities. As ATLP successfully achieves its objectives it could evolve into a new programme to help Member States develop and/or strengthen their continuing education systems. The new programme now offered by UNESCO PROAP as an extension of ATLP has been titled ATLP-CE. This present volume is the first in a series of eight for the ATLP-CE Project. The issues and challenges of modifying ATLP into a support and training programme for continuing education (i.e. to convert ATLP to ATLP-CE) have been broadly addressed in Volume 10 of ATLP itself. That volume is entitled Post-literacy Activities and Continuing Education (see Figure 4.1). Readers are invited to study the ATLP Volumes, especially Volumes 1, 2, 3 and 10 before proceeding further with ATLP-CE. B. ATLP-CE and the Evolution of a Learning Society In developing societies there has been and in most there continues to be an evolution or growth from a stage where the majority of people are illiterate through well defined stages, such as functional literacy for most, to autonomous learning for most to the appearance finally of a learning society in which all adult societal agencies and all citizens are involved in education. The phases of this societal evolution are given in figure 4.3. This is a reproduction of figure 1.1 from ATLP Volume 10. The essential mechanism for achieving the transition from neo-literacy to the emergence of a learning society is continuing education. ATLP-CE aims to assist Member States establish systematic policies and a well-planned infrastructure for continuing education, to provide guidelines for training continuing education personnel and to devise a system of delivering continuing education to all citizens in such a way that the elements of a learning society can begin early in development and be enriched as the system evolves. C. The Essential Framework for ATLP-CE Under APPEAL there are projects, programmes and activities in three interacting areas (i) Eradication of Illiteracy (EOI) (ii) Universal Primary Education (UPE) and (iii) Continuing Education (CE). In the case of eradication of illiteracy the APPEAL ATLP project has been a main focus. The overall framework for ATLP is illustrated below in Figure 4.4 which is reproduced here from the preface in each ATLP Volume. 31 Figure 4.3 Stages in the evolution of learning society. To the left and right solid lines indicate phases of maximum involment and dotted lines represent either extensions or early origins. For example while lifelong learning by definition is from birth to death for adults, meaningful engagement in life-long learning cannot begin until a person is a genuinely autonomous learner. For more detail see ATLP Volume 10. Literacy process Adult target General educationnal processes and systems ILLITERATES SEMI-LITERATE NEO-LITERATES ADEQUATELY FUNCTIONAL LITERATES AUTONOMOUS LEARNERS LEARNING SOCIETY 32 In ATLP the three target levels in the central column of the diagram (levels A, B and C) are involved in literacy development but there are close links with UPE and CE. The main output of the system is a series of literacy training manuals (1-24) to be developed by Member States using ATLP principles and exemplars as broad guidelines. A similar type of framework is proposed for ATLP-CE and this is illustrated in figure 4.5 APPEALINTERNATIONAL LITERACY NETWORK CONTINUING EDUCATION EOI LEVEL A MANAGEMENT MANUAL Figure 4.4 The general framework for ATLP The targets in the central column of the diagram (figure 4.5) are the continuing education personnel at levels A, B and C but as in the case of ATLP there are links with the other components of APPEAL. A key difference between ATLP and ATLP-CE is the nature of the output suggested for Member States. In the case of ATLP it is a training curriculum, trained personnel and a systematic set of Mining materials. In the case of ATLP-CE it is the development of a planned CE policy, an effective infrastructure, trained personnel and a delivery system at local level which will accelerate the evolution of a learning society.

(i) a policy determined at level A based on national development plans; (ii) an effective and efficient cadre of professionally trained CE personnel at level B.; (iii) development of a CE network nationally and provincially with direct local access; (iv) a system of local entry points in the form of district level learning centres at level C; (v) a broad variety of local providers who are part of the CE network and whose programmes are known to the learning centres. Providers would come from the formal, non-formal and informal education subsectors; (vi) ready access by all citizens to CE activities at local level, partly through a learning centre and partly by direct contact with a provider. ATLP-CE provides guidelines for the establishment of such a system, especially on how to train personnel at levels A, B and C. Further details of the infrastructure proposed under ATLP-CE are given in Chapter 5. D. Immediate Focus of ATLP-CE At present most Member States of Asia and the Pacific are involved in a range of continuing education activities. A survey suggests that in the main there may be grouped into six categories as follows: a) Post-literacy b) Equivalency c) Quality of life improvement d) Income-generation e) Individual interests f) Future orientation Each of these categories is defined and described elsewhere (Chapters I and 7). While all these types of programme can be accommodated within the overall policies and infrastructure proposed under ATLP-CE, each has its own specific types of delivery systems. ATLP-CE therefore has provided separate guidelines for each type and there is an ATLP-CE Volume on each. 35 The six types of programme promoted under ATLP-CE also reflect the concerns of the World Conference on Education for All which was held in Jomtien, Thailand in March 1990 and set out in its report World Declaration on Education for All Meeting Basic Learning Needs. This report states that all citizens should have the knowledge, skills. values and attitudes required to: • survive and develop to full capacities • live and work in dignity • participate fully in development • improve the quality of their lives • make informed decisions • continue learning It is clear that the ATLP-CE programme types with their focus on personal growth, income generation, quality of life improvement, individual interests and future development are consistent with these principles. ATLP-CE indicates how such needs can be satisfied through a well organized system of continuing education. E. Scope and Development of ATLP-CE Resources produced under ATLP-CE consist of eight volumes as follows: 1. Continuing Education New Policies and Directions 2. Post-Literacy Programmes 3. Equivalency Programmes 4. Income-Generating Programmes 5. Qualify of Life Improvement Programmes 6. The Promotion of Individual Interests through Continuing Education 7. Future-Oriented Programmes 8. Learning Centres Member States are invited to join in a series of Sub-Regional Workshops and later to run in-country national workshops in the understanding and application of the principles of ATLPCE. It should be stressed however, that ATLP-CE, like ATLP, is in no way prescriptive. It offers guidelines and exemplars only and these should be interpreted by Member States entirely according to their needs and circumstances. 36 Chapter 5 AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO LEARNING CENTRES PART 1: GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE A. General Background The status and level of development of Continuing Education systems in Member States of Asia and the Pacific is uneven (chapter 3). In particular, infrastructures for continuing education vary a great deal from country to country. In some, continuing education occurs without any co-ordinating body or authority and programmes are presented by any agencies which may wish to be involved on a purely ad hoc basis. In other countries CE is the main responsibility of the Ministry of Education but many other ministries and agencies may also offer programmes (e.g. health, agriculture. employment and industry) and these may not be coordinated. In almost all countries many non-government agencies are involved but they frequently work on their own and there are no links with government. In the cases where the Ministry of Education is responsible or mainly responsible for government initiatives in CUE the precise agencies or departments within the ministry vary from system to system. In some countries the formal education subsector at primary, secondary and university level is given the responsibility for Continuing education as an extension of its normal work. School teachers give CE courses after school hours and schools become afternoon and evening community schools and colleges. In others. special departments of non-formal and/or adult education and/or continuing education accept responsibility. Sometimes their programmes and delivery systems are broad and varied and sometimes narrower and more limited in range and scope. Some Member States have clear-cut national policies for continuing education, others have not. Some have organizational networks in place at all levels, others have none. Some have set up efficient management and training systems for CE and others have only partial systems. Very few countries in the Region have perceived CE both as (i) a viable alternative to formal education and (ii) an agency for human resource development after the completion of formal education and so as the energizer of socio-economic development. Most therefore, tend to down-grade the relative significance of CE vis-a-vis formal education. Resources for the development of an infrastructure for CE represent only a small fraction (less than one per cent) of the resources provided for formal schooling, and yet continuing education provides an opportunity for life-long learning whereas formal education caters, at most, for only about one third of the life span. 37 This chapter attempts to describe a broad infrastructure for CE as an exemplar. Each Member State would need to interpret this relative to its own circumstances and concerns, but hopefully it may provide a broad framework for establishing or strengthening CE systems. B. Overall Coordination In each country there should be a National Coordination Committee or National Council for Continuing Education (NCCCE). While this should perhaps be administered by the Ministry of Education and chaired by the Minister for Education, it should be a representative body with membership from all government agencies providing continuing education from the formal educational system and from relevant non-government agencies. NCCCE should be a high level policy making body with considerable authority and status and with strong financial resources and with support personnel. It should have a permanent Executive Committee of civil servants to implement its policies. The functions of an NCCCE would be to 1) determine and direct all continuing education activities towards the vision of socio-economic development of a country; 2) determine the types of programmes to be promoted under CE; 3) plan for and ensure the production of high quality continuing education materials; 4) plan training programmes for all levels of CE personnel. 5) identify target groups and promote delivery systems to meet their needs; 6) formulate guidelines for planning, co-ordinating and evaluating continuing education activities. In order to be maximally effective the NCCCE and its Executive Committee should have direct organisational links with the National Planning Commission, with relevant research and development units and with any existing future oriented instrumentalities such as a National Commission for the Future. It should establish and promote national level «think tanks» and have access to a range of data banks. 38 The NCCCE should also perceive its role as responding to emerging needs at local level. Therefore, it should not only be «top-down» in its orientation but should receive feedback from and respond to changing needs and circumstances at all levels of the system. In their turn, however, the middle and local levels of the CE infrastructure should develop their activities within the policy framework determined by the NCCCE. NCCCE should also promote the development of a nation-wide CE network by co-ordinating the disparate networks established at provincial level (see Section C). C. Middle Level Management In each province, region or state, there should be a Provincial Co-ordinating Committee or Council for Continuing Education (PCCCE) and each should have its executive body. As in the case of NCCCE each PCCCE should be a representative body. Its functions could be as follows: 1. Interpret and apply NCCCE policy at provincial level 2. Establish a provincial network for CE and relate this to the national network 3. Promote delivery systems, programmes, activities and agencies for CE throughout the province. 4. Identify categories of clientele and cater for their needs 5. Establish a field consultancy service 6. Train providers in the principles and practice of CE 7. Develop good quality materials for continuing education and also help providers produce their own materials. 8. Promote and supervise the establishment of local learning centres 9. Sponsor research and development in CE 10. Monitor and evaluate the impact of CE at provincial and local levels. At provincial level a professional body of continuing education personnel needs to be established and trained to perform the tasks listed above. In some instances the training may be provided by the formal system (by universities and colleges in particular) and in others by inhouse on job systems and by internal staff development activities. D. Points of Delivery at Local Level Provision of opportunity for lifelong learning, that is continuing education. should be available to all adults everywhere. This implies that any infrastructure for continuing education 39 should ensure that programmes and activities are in place locally and that there is ready access to them. Since continuing education can be provided by the formal, non-formal and informal (self learning) subsectors, and since there are many types of continuing education such as postliteracy, equivalency, quality of life, individual interests and so on, it follows that there is usually a multiplicity of agencies providing activities in any given locality see figure 5.1 (reproduced from Volume 10 of the ATLP series). The question arises to what extent should there be intervention and coordination to ensure (i) quality of provision (ii) ready access (iii) coordinated effort and lack of redundancy and (iv) maximum impact. As a minimum two things should occur: 1) All the agencies in any given locality should be part of the provincial continuing education network established by level B personnel. Their work should be facilitated by training offered to them from level B and by help given in designing and providing programmes and activities. 2) A coordinating agency or «entry point» in the form of a Learning Centre should be established in each district or locality. In rural areas there should be one in each village and township. In urban areas there should be one for each city municipality or cluster of suburbs. Such learning centres would have several major roles. These are summarised below: (i) Act as clearing houses of information about CE in the local area and promote the idea of CE locally. (ii) Encourage more local agencies to offer CE and promote local participation. (iii) Offer general learning facilities to the local people(e.g. reading centres, meeting halls), and especially promote the development of a reading habit. (iv) Provide management bases for CE field consultants and visiting level B personnel (v) Act as providing agencies in their own right especially in areas such as basic literacy, post-literacy, income generation and quality of life. Par time staff should be appointed to provide these programmes. (vi) Act as social and community centres for the local people. (v) Provide general community services e.g. health monitoring; agricultural extension; guidance and counselling service and the like. 40 Figure 5.1 A Classification of Some of the Agencies Providing Continuing Education Schools CollegesUniversitiesPolytechnicsAgricultural Institutes Informal Sub-sector Formal Non-formal Non-formal Institutions and Programmes Non-Institutional Resources for Individuals Individual learning projects Formal and non-formal Sub-sectors 41 Correspondence courses Part-time classes Communitybased programmes Such centres should be family oriented and managed by the local people. A representative management committee would need to be established for each. The centres may or may not have formal links with the PCCCE, but in any event they should work with it in close cooperation. E. Overall Infrastructure In summary an effective infrastructure for CE should be established at three levels. Level A: At national level a policy making and coordinating body (NCCCE) should be established. Level B: In each province there should be a Coordinating Committee (PCCCE) to interpret policy, promote CE, train providers and facilitate activities. Level C: In each district (locality) there should be a multiplicity of CE providers (agencies). Their work should be facilitated and in part coordinated by local learning centres managed by committees of local residents. In interpreting the infrastructure illustrated in figure 5.2 it is important to appreciate that the linkages between levels and instrumentalities represent (i) communication pathways and (ii) lines of interactive intervention. Arrow heads have not been shown because the «flow» can occur in any direction between all points of the system. For example policies formulated at level A should not only be based on ideas generated at that level but on feedback received from levels B and C. Middle level management (level B) works with level A and facilitates the work of level C. It is also important to appreciate that the various local providing agencies should not be «controlled» by the system but facilitated by it. If any provider should wish to stand aside from the infrastructure or not be part of the CE network that provider should have the right to be independent. This is an important aspect of any CE infrastructure. It should encourage diversity and a multiplicity of delivery systems. Such systems should not be too constrained by bureaucratic policy or regulations. Creative differences, independent lines of thought and a multiplicity of agencies should be promoted and coordinating agencies such as a PCCCE or a local learning centre should not coerce but encourage and help. 42 This overall scheme is illustrated in figure 5.2 below: CABINET National Planning Authority NCCCE 43 International network R & D Centres Data Banks Think tanks NCCCE Executives Commision for the Future PCCCE PCCCE Executive Trainers Councellors Learning Centre Management Committee Learning Centre Programme Designers Resource Developers Institutional learning Monitors Evaluators Field Consultants Non-Institutional learning Providing Agencies Resources Facilities Figure 5.2: An infrastructure for continuing education NCCCE = National Coordinating Committee for Continuing Education PCCCE = Provincial Coordinating Committeefor Continuing Education PART II LEARNING CENTRES A. Definition and types In broad terms a learning centre is simply any organized place where a person may learn. Schools, polytechnics, museums, libraries and commercial in-house training units are thus learning centres. Under APPEAL, however, and especially under ATLP-CE, the concept has a more specific meaning. It generally refers to a local centre outside the formal education system for a village or an urban community managed by the local people and providing (i) resources for local development and family oriented learning and (ii) information about the what, how, where and when individuals can engage in various types of continuing education locally. Before examining the idea of an ATLP-CE learning centre in greater detail it perhaps may be appropriate to review what the concept means in more general terms. Basically there are three types of learning centre; (i) institution-based (ii) community based and (iii) comprehensive. Type I: Institution-Based: These are centres within an educational or training institution which provide courses and activities for students of that institution and/or members of the general public. Activities are either remedial in nature or course equivalents presented by alternative means. An example is the learning centre network in the technical colleges of Australia. In these centres courses are offered to both members of the public and to students of the colleges in (i) basic literacy (ii) post-literacy (iii) English for non-English speaking migrants, (iv) specific educational remediation and (v) courses of the college presented by alternative means. Activities are all individualised and learning is self-paced. Type II: C o m m u n i t y B a s e d : Village or Urban Centres managed by local people and focusing on the family as a learning unit. They are outside the formal system but may help people obtain formal qualifications by alternative means. They may themselves be providers. They all help individuals, however, to learn either through individual unstructured activities or through the activities of local providers. This is the type of centre promoted under ATLP-CE. Type III: Comprehensive: This type is as yet only theoretical. It is the type proposed by Malcolm Knowles as a holistic life-long learning centre which subsumes the formal, non-formal and informal subsectors into one system and caters for all the learning needs of all people throughout life2. According to Knowles, comprehensive learning centres should facilitate all learning projects undertaken by individuals. They would coordinate the activities of all educational providers in a given community to meet the educational needs of each individual. An individual 2 Knowles, Malcolm S. Creating lifelong learning communities. A paper prepared for the UNESCO Institute for Education, Hamburg, Germany, January 1983. 44 would go to the centre and (i) have his or her learning skills assessed, (ii) have his or her development stages and life role needs diagnosed (iii) meet an educational planner who would help set learning objectives and advise on how they could be achieved and (iv) undertake a learning plan with one or more providers monitored by the centre. The centre would then assess and evaluate outcomes of the learning plan and move the learner on to the next project. The Knowles model is illustrated in figure 5.3. Under the Knowles model all societal agencies are educational providers and the society as a whole is a learning society. B. Learning Centres Under ATLP CE Under ATLP-CE Knowles’ type III comprehensive learning centre could be seen as a long term ideal goal which would not only replace the present system of formal education but also integrate all elements of non-formal and informal education for lifelong learning. T h i s development has not yet occurred anywhere in the world but as societies especially in the Third world, become more and more disillusioned with formal schooling, then this approach could well emerge as a viable alternative. At the present stage of development of most countries of Asia and the Pacific Type II i.e. community-based learning centers, should be promoted. According to Boonlerd Masang3 such centres, should be family oriented and should integrate learning, working and living. They should be concerned essentially with basic education, skills training and in providing up-to-date news and information as shown in figure 5.4. The ATLP-CE concept of community based centres is, however, somewhat broader than that envisaged by the model given in figure 5.4. A community-based learning centre under ATLP-CE should not only be a local provider of the activities suggested by Masang (Figure 5.4) but should facilitate access to a full range of CE activities including programmes catering for quality of life improvement, post-literacy, equivalency, individual interests and so on (see Chapter 6). It should be both a direct provider and a link with all other local providers. It should encourage both unstructured and structured learning by all adult citizens. It should help individuals set and achieve learning objectives appropriate to their individual stages of personal and societal development and it should ensure that this process continues throughout life. This role for community based learning centre under ATLP-CE is highly professional and although each centre should be managed by the local people it serves it should have access to well qualified continuing educational advisers level B field consultants, programme designers and so on. It should be part of a provincial/national CE network and have effective and efficient links with all relevant local providers. Its functions should be as set out in Part I Section D of this chapter. 3 Masang, Boonlerd. A Proposal for lifelong education system at the village level in Thailand.

Conclusion In establishing an infrastructure for continuing education the central aim is to ensure that a comprehensive range of appropriate and effective opportunities for lifelong learning is available for al adults. This means that a full range of programmes and activities should be available in each locality. To facilitate access and utilization, local community based learning centres become a key to success. Local people should perceive their learning centres not just as places to meet and to learn basics, but as an entry point to a whole system of CE which can cater for all their learning needs throughout life. Seen from the perspective of the individual learner, an infrastructure for CE is in place to service the needs of the people: individual citizens; single families; small groups, and local communities. There is, however, another perspective. Individual needs most also relate to the needs and concerns of the society and of the nation as a whole. The infrastructure therefore must also ensure that continuing education grows in support of national development policies and plans, and the needs of individuals are balanced against those of the entire nation. Ideas and policies therefore must flow freely from bottom-up and from top-down and the infrastructure must allow for creative diversity as well as focused development. 52 Chapter 6 STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTING CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAMMES ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS A. Introduction The overall stages is the implementation of a coherent system of continuing education in a particular country have been reviewed in Chapters 4 and 5. They involved (i) the integration of continuing education in the national socio-economic development plan; (ii) establishment of or strengthening an existing national body for co-ordinating continuing education programmes; (iii) setting up or upgrading an existing infrastructure for continuing education programmes; and (iv) establishment of a mechanism for administering the various types of continuing education programmes. In Chapter 5 an infrastructure which coordinated activities at three levels (i) national (ii) provincial and (iii) local was advocated. It was noted that this corresponds to the three levels of personnel provided for under ATLP Level A: Senior Administrators and Policy Makers [National level] Level B: Provincial/District Supervisors; Trainers of Trainers Level C: Trainers or presenters [Local level] As in the case of basic literacy programmes a continuing education infrastructure requires clear management, coordination and evaluation policies at national level (level A). At provincial level (level B) it requires well organized networking, training and supervision and an effective and efficient system of administration. At local level (level C) there is need for effective institutions, agencies and individuals to actually provide direct continuing education opportunities and a system of supervisors and field consultants to monitor and upgrade all aspects of the programmes. The precise administrative policies and responsibilities to be developed at each level would vary according to the types of continuing education programmes involved. For example, post-literacy programmes have specific purposes and approaches which are in marked contrast to programmes concerned with improvement in overall quality of life or in the promotion of individual interests for personal growth. 53 This chapter presents basic checklists of administrative policies and strategies for each of the six types of continuing education programmes as defined in Chapter I Section D. B. Strategies for Post-Literacy Promotion Programmes (PLPs) DEFINITION: Post-Literacy Programmes aim to maintain and enhance basic literacy, numeracy and problem solving skills, giving individuals s u fficient general basic work skills enabling them to function effectively in their societies. Since post-literacy promotion programmes are concerned with maintaining and enhancing basic literacy, numeracy and problem solving skills so as to ensure social effectiveness they have many administrative features in common with basic literacy programmes as catered for by ATLP. They require a sensitive policy making system at level A; good literacy training, networking and supervisory systems at level B and effective literacy classes at level C. What is especially needed, however, is an upgrading of the skills of literacy personnel to enable them to deal with more sophisticated aspects of literacy such as advanced reading skills, creative writing and problem solving. The following box lists some of the administrative strategies and policies which should be promoted at national, provincial and local levels for these types of activities. I. POST-LITERACY PROMOTION PROGRAMMES National level 1. Integrating post-literacy programmes with other development initiatives by strengthening linkages between agencies/organizations, both government and nongovernment, involved in social services and development programmes. 2. Reinforcing pre-literacy, literacy and post-literacy programmes as an expansion of the ATLP approach by providing varied modes and opportunities through multisectoral linkages. 3. Improving the internal efficiency of post-literacy programmes by instituting policy measures and development programmes geared towards the effective delivery of post-literacy promotion programmes at all levels. 4. Giving increased emphasis to the needs of special groups of learners, such as women, cultural sub-communities and the disabled, by providing post-literacy programmes suited to their needs. 5. Focusing on minimum essential learning needs for the meaningful and productive life of adults in terms of content (knowledge) and psychological processes (adult learning). 54 6. Developing a training plan for post-literacy teachers and supervisors. 7. Monitoring and evaluating post-literacy programmes at national level especially the promotion of input studies in relation to national development policies. Provincial Level 1. Reflecting and implementing all aspects of national policy at provincial and local levels. 2. Training post-literacy teachers and supervisors including extension workers from various sectoral agencies to complement the work of school teachers and others from the formal educational sector. 3. Strengthening supportive programmes like mobile libraries and provision of rural newspapers, books and other development materials. 4. Enhancing/improving post-literacy training programmes and activities by: 4.1 Developing varied teaching-learning materials and methodologies appropriate to clientele needs. 4.2 Using non-traditional delivery modes e.g. correspondence programmes, distance learning, mass media, etc. 4.3 Integrating «learning», «working» and «living» at community level for an environment conducive to «whole of life» learning. 4.4 Utilizing local resources and relevant teaching aids. 5. Strengthening linkages between involved agencies at the provincial level. 6. Monitoring and evaluating provincial post-literacy programmes. Local Level 1. Ensuring the involvement of local people in planning, implementing and evaluating post-literacy programmes. 2. Utilizing local people as instructors or teachers in post-literacy programmes. 3. Assessing local resources. 4. Organizing post-literacy programmes at all appropriate local venues 5. Encouraging volunteerism at local level. 55 C. Strategies for Equivalency Programmes (EPs) DEFINITION: Equivalency Programmes are designed as alternative education programmes equivalent to existing formal general or vocational education. Since Equivalency Programmes as part of continuing education provide alternative education equivalent to upper primary and above, they have many administrative features in common with both basic literacy programmes and with the formal educational system. From an administrative point of view a system of continuing education should ensure that there are sufficient numbers and types of educational agencies providing such programmes; that an equitable system of accreditation is developed and that appropriate records of certification are developed and maintained. II. EQUIVALENCY PROGRAMMES National Level 1. Defining the standard competencies for post-literacy appropriate for entry into defined grades of education. 2. Providing for certification of equivalent accreditation by appropriate bodies such as Academic Award Boards or selected universities and colleges. 3. Establishing a comprehensive system of locating, identifying, monitoring, evaluating and accrediting those post-literacy programmes which prepare for entry or transfer into specified levels of education. 4. Formulating guidelines for national policy on recognition of various alternative programmes and records. Provincial Level 1. Advocating equivalency programmes/and reflecting national policy at provincial level. 2. Preparing rules and regulations for equivalency. 3. Organizing the development and administration of equivalency tests. 4. Developing and administering a counselling and advisory service at provincial level based on a data bank. 56 Local Level 1. Promoting equivalency programmes. 2. Organizing equivalency courses. 3. Developing a local advisory service on equivalency opportunities. D. Strategies for Income Generating Programmes (IGPs) DEFINITION: Income-Generating Programmes help participants acquire or upgrade vocational skills and enable them to conduct income-generating activities. IGPs are those vocational continuing education programmes delivered in a variety of contexts and which are directed in particular towards those people who are currently not selfsufficient in a modern world, that is those persons at or below the poverty line. Programmes for generating income are especially significant in rural areas, for women, and for unemployed youth. While vocational courses are well developed in most countries within technical colleges and polytechnics, formal education alone cannot meet the demand or cater for the variety of opportunities required by the community. Administratively, however, there are some points in common between policies and strategies developed in formal technical and vocational education and in income generating programmes within the context of continuing education. For example, both types of approach depend for success on careful market analysis. III. INCOME GENERATING PROGRAMMES National Level 1. Examining national policies for agriculture, trade and industry, tourism etc. present and prospective to identify labour requirements. 2. Surveying the labour market situation; levels of manpower skills; per cent of population joining labour market; labour demand; existing resources and resource potential; existing agencies offering IGPs. 3. Analyzing the national Human Resource Development Plan (HRD) to identify needs and gaps. 4. Promoting awareness programmes to build favourable attitudes towards national policy. 5. Promoting guidelines for the development of curriculum and teaching/learning materials for IGPs. 57 6. Developing guidelines for staff development e.g. training in needs assessment, curriculum development, and so on. 7. Developing guidelines for vocational guidance and counselling. 8. Developing guidelines for co-ordination and networking. 9. Monitoring and evaluating all aspects of the programme, including guidelines for evaluation of IGPs in line with the HRD Plan. 10. Developing guidelines for marketing IGP products. 11. Creating or utilizing an existing National Implementing Co-ordinating Body/ Committee. 12. Establishing a mechanism for mobilising resources financial and human for IGPs. 13. Utilizing mass media for the delivery of IGPs. 14. Developing guidelines for the development of R & D for IGPs. Provincial Level 1. Interpreting and adapting all national policies and strategies in the context of provincial situations and needs. 2. Establishing a provincial implementing and co-ordinating body/committee. 3. Training IGP/CE personnel. 4. Providing support to institutions implementing IGPs. 5. Advocating expansion of IGPs. 6. Involving NGOs/Private sector in IGP activities. Local Level 1. Establishing a mechanism to ensure local people’s involvement in planning, implementing and evaluating community programmes and activities. 2. Promoting guidance and counselling services, especially on vocational and marketing issues. 3. Encouraging local participation in the programme with emphasis on disadvantaged groups. 4. Devising local marketing strategies. 58 5. Assessing local needs, wants and resources in regard to training and marketing. 6. Devising programmes and learning materials to suit local needs and situations. 7. Utilizing local experts as teachers, especially those representing successful income generating activities. 8. Encouraging volunteerism. 9. Establishing linkages between local income-generating activities. E. Strategies for Quality of Life Improvement Programmes (QLIPs) DEFINITION: Quality of Life Improvement Programmes aim to equip learners and the community with that essential knowledge, attitudes, values and skills to enable them to improve quality of life as individuals and as members of the community. In Quality of Life Improvement Programmes the emphasis tends to be broader and more all encompassing than some other types of continuing education. This is because, by definition, such programmes aim to equip the community as a whole with essential knowledge attitudes and skills which are universally required for adequate functioning in society and which foster essential improvement in life styles and living standards. The programmes are thus universal in target and comprehensive in terms of basic social functionality. Administratively, therefore, the main aim is to mobilize all relevant agencies, instrumentalities and resources which will ensure that all citizens have access to these types of activities. IV. QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMMES National Level 1. Specifying QLIP indicators at family level for all citizens. 2. Identifying GO’s and NGO’s involved in activities related to QLIP and promoting co-ordination between them. 3. Identifying essential knowledge, attitudes, values and skills to promote QLIPs. 4. Formulating guidelines for planning and implementating relevant QLIPs for different target groups with special emphasis on women and other disadvantaged groups. 5. Identifying and assessing existing programmes addressing QLIP needs and concerns. 6. Designing a training plan for QLIP personnel. 59 7. Utilizing multi-media for advocacy and delivery of QLIP programmes 8. Devising a mechanisms for mobilizing resources, e.g. youth groups, business institutions, industry, and so on. 9. Monitoring and evaluating all phases of the programmes. Provincial Level 1. Adapting national strategies and plans to meet provincial needs and programme requirements. 2. Setting up or utilising existing institutional mechanisms. 3. Mobilizing NGO’s and community organisations to offer QLIPs. 4. Selecting and training QLIP personnel. 5. Encouraging community involvement and volunteerism, including youth groups in QLIPs. Local Level 1. Encouraging and motivating clientele groups to participate in QLIPs. 2. Assessing local needs through a participatory processes. 3. Utilizing maximum local resources for QLIPs. 4. Devising programmes to meet local needs. 5. Establishing a mechanism to ensure local participation in programme planning, implementation and evaluation. F. Strategies for Individual Interest Programmes (IIP) DEFINITION: Individual Interest Promotion Programmes provide opportunity for individuals to participate in and learn about their chosen social, cultural, spiritual, health, physical and artistic interests. In contrast to Quality of Life Programmes which aim to establish a common base line of effective living for all citizens, individual interest activities within continuing education cater for each persons special concerns and personal objectives. They may be leisure time interests such as sports or hobbies; they may be related to cognitive growth, (study of a particular subject for example) or they may cater for social needs and so on. They promote personal growth in areas of specialized interest. The main thrust in the administration of such programmes is to encourage the provision of as wide a range of activities as possible reflecting the highly diverse interests of the community. Because many agencies may provide special interest activities an important 60 administrative role is to make sure such agencies are known to potential clientele. V. INDIVIDUAL INTEREST PROGRAMMES National Level 1. Preparing and maintaining an inventory of agencies offering special interest CE programmes. 2. Disseminating information through mass media. 3. Encouraging creation of special interest groups and other self-initiated programmes and activities. 4. Providing technical support to GOs and NGOs involved in IIPs. 5. Publicizing benefits gained from participation in special interest CE programmes, e.g., case studies, testimonials and so on. Provincial Level 1. Adapting the national IIP plans and strategies to provincial and local needs. 2. Advocating participation in IIP. 3. Encouraging GOs and NGOs to undertake IIP. 4. Creating learning centres or utilizing existing infrastructures, especially formal school facilities, for IIP activities. Local Level 1. Creating a favorable conducive atmosphere for individuals to participate in activities in pursuit of their personal interests. 2. Developing advanced reading skills and inculcating a reading habit through provision of appropriate and well written reading materials relevant to the interests of individuals. 3. Making available national and provincial resources for local programmes. 4. Encouraging people to utilize leisure time constructively. 61 G. Strategies for Future Oriented Programmes (FOs) DEFINITION: Future Oriented Programmes give workers, professionals, regional and national community leaders, villagers, businessmen and planners new skill, knowledge and techniques to adapt themselves and their organizations to growing social and technological changes. While all types of continuing education have national, societal or personal development aspects, some programmes are needed which directly assist individuals and organizations adapt and respond to social and technological change. In administering such programmes the main focus is to see that continuing education is in line with overall plans for national socio-economic development; to identify and support agencies and individuals with forward looking ideas, and to help organizations and individuals who perceive the need for change or who are involved in change. VI. FUTURE ORIENTED PROGRAMMES National Level 1. Integrating future-oriented CE programmes into the socio-economic development plan of the country. 2. Instituting research and development for the expansion of future-oriented CE. 3. Formulating policy in regard to future oriented Continuing Education. 4. Strengthening the Continuing Education network especially by anticipating future growth points and identifying and supporting effective change agencies. 5. Encouraging development of appropriate technology. 6. Encouraging technology transfer by fostering inter-country linkages. 7. Assessing and upgrading human, institutional and financial resources. 8. Fostering R & D in technological development as input into FO Continuing Education. 9. Preparing guidelines for generating wider involvement of business, industries, entrepreneurs and labour organisations in FO Continuing Education. 10. Promoting systematic organisational change and renewal and linking this to the FO Continuing Education system. 11. Developing «think-tanks» for future social and economic growth in relation to FO Continuing Education. 62 Provincial Level 1. Adapting and integrating all national policies, strategies and plans relevant to FO CE at the provincial level. 2. Establishing provincial implementing and co-ordinating bodies/ committees. 3. Ensuring access to new information by all FO Continuing Education providers in the province. 4. Providing future-oriented training for FO Continuing Education personnel. 5. Developing relevant instructional materials for FO Continuing Education personnel. 6. Strengthening vertical and horizontal co-ordination. 7. Receiving and coordinating data from local levels about social and technological trends and about the effectiveness of future oriented CE. Local Level 1. Preparing guidelines for local growth and development for implementing FO Continuing Education. 2. Identifying local change agents and encouraging their involvement in FO Continuing Education. 3. Encouraging self-initiated learning and local management of initiatives in FO Continuing Education. 4. Providing regular training and re-training of local FO Continuing Education personnel. 5. Developing/adapting learning materials which reflect latest ideas and future developments. 6. Monitoring and evaluating future oriented FO Continuing Education at the local level. H. Conclusion The administrative strategies and policies as outlined in this chapter provide only very broad guidelines which would need to be interpreted and adapted according to the needs and circumstances of each Member State. A most important aspect which all countries need to keep in mind, however, is that in planning and administering programmes of continuing education national socio-economic development plans should provide a general framework. Since continuing education is, by definition, the opportunity for adults to engage in life-long education after they have completed primary schooling or its equivalent, it is important that the learning 63 accumulated in the society as a whole, will directly contribute to its planned growth and development. A second important aspect is that administrators should also view continuing education as a mechanism for human resource development and not merely as an agency for economic and material growth. This implies that strategies and policies should be humanistic in orientation. A careful balance needs to be maintained between the needs and aspirations of individuals and the needs and aspirations of the nation as a whole. A further point is that administration of continuing education is both from the top-down and from the bottom-up. General national policies and strategies must be reflected downward at all levels. These policies should be supportive and catalytic not coercive or authoritarian. At the same time the needs, wants and concerns of local organizations and individuals need to be catered f o r. In particular the devolution of management should be promoted. Organizations and individuals should be encouraged to establish agencies and activities for continuing education, to set their own learning objectives and to accept responsibility for their own learning. Continuing Education is for the people and it should be managed by them. 64 Chapter 7 CLIENTELE, DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND LEARNING RESOURCES FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION A. Introduction The various types of continuing education programmes defined and briefly outlined in Chapter 6 each has its own characteristics in regard to target clientele, its delivery system (modality) and the resources required. This chapter identifies these characteristics, presenting them in a checklist format. By clientele is meant the people for whom the programmes are intended. In the case of Post Literacy Programmes, for instance, the clientele are likely to be those who are only basically literate and school dropouts and semiliterate adults will probably form the largest groups. Such people generally lack advanced reading skills, frequently are unemployed or are otherwise socially disadvantaged, and usually have low incomes. It is important to define and characterise the clientele in this way in order to plan the most appropriate delivery system or modality for them and determine the types of resources they need. By delivery system or modality is meant the mode by which the programme is presented perhaps in a classroom type setting using various face-to-face teaching methods, through a correspondence course or through individual self-monitored study. Delivery systems may also involve more specialized and less conventional approaches. For example, in Income Generating Programmes, hobby groups could be established, on-job training provided or exhibitions and product or trade fairs mounted, to name just a few of the possibilities. The modality selected must be suitable for the clientele involved and for the types of activities to be included in the programme. As an example, in the case of future oriented programmes where the clientele are likely to be people who need help with implementing change, delivery systems which ensure access to new knowledge and technologies are likely to be successful. By «resource» is meant the personnel needed; the learning materials; support items such as venues, furnishings and equipment, and administrative resources such as record keeping systems. Each type of continuing education programme has its own resource needs consistent with its objectives and scope. Apart from the issue of «types of programmes» as defined and described in Chapter 1 and Chapter 6 there is another type of classification of continuing education activities which should be taken into consideration when reviewing clientele; delivery systems and learning resources. This classification, based on a model developed by G. Roger Snell, is given in figure 7.11. 1 Snell, G. Roger The Providers Perspective for Research on Life-long Learning Paper presented as part of a symposium entitled: «Research Perspectives on the Adult Years of Life-long Learning», AERAAnnual Meeting, March 27-31,1978, Toronto, Canada. P.2. 65 Figure 7.1 shows that adult learning opportunities (i.e. continuing education activities) can be thought of either as being (a) deliberately planned with learning objectives in mind or (b) as random or unplanned. Most unplanned learning in incidental or at least casual and without clear-cut objectives. More deliberately planned experiences and activities may occur in formal, non-formal or informal education. They are of two types: (AI) those provided by the learner himself or herself or by an informal self-initiated learning group; and (A2) those provided by an agent (institution, organisation, person) other than the learner. Self-provided learning opportunities (At) include learning projects2 that are planned and directed by a learner or group of learners with minimal outside assistance. Learning opportunities provided by others (type A2) 2 As defined by Tough, Allen The Adult’s learning projects: a fresh approach to theory and practice in adult learning. Research in Education Series No. 1. Toronto, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, 1971. 66 LIFELONG LEARNING INFANT/CHILD LEARNING ADULT LEARNING ADOLESCENT/ YOUTH LEARNING ADULT LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES (A) DELIBERATE/ PLANNED (B) RANDOM/ UNPLANNED (A1) (A2) PROVIDED BYADULT PROVIDED BY LEARNER OR LEARNING INSTITUTION, GROUPWITH MINIMAL ORGANIZATION, OR INTERVENTION FROM PERSON OTHER THAN OUTSIDE SOURCES ADULT LEARNER OR (Informal) LEARNING GROUP (Formal or Non-Formal) Figure 7.1 A classification scheme for continuing education activities. (Based on G. Roger Snell, 1978). Note that as defined orderAPPEAL, continuing education clients include both adults and post-primary school youth. include courses, programmes and other organized activities planned and directed by someone other than the learner or the learning group, by some formal or non-formal educational institution, or by some basically non-educational institution (e.g. business or industry) and by groups with a designated teacher or resource person. This idea was also discussed in Chapter 5 see figure 5.1. The importance of these ideas by Roger Snell is that they open our thinking about the range of continuing education activities away from programmes and courses alone. This idea is fully consistent institutionally based with the UNESCO concept of a learning society in which all agencies are seen to be instrumentalities for learning. This type of classification of continuing education activities should be kept in mind when interpreting the checklists presented below in sections B to G of this chapter. Some of the programme types may contain some random unplanned elements in balance with more that are deliberately planned. Some of the deliberately planned activities within a particular programme type may be provided by the learners themselves and some by others. Delivery systems and resources, therefore, have been kept flexible and varied to cater for these various approaches. B. Post Literacy Promotion Programmes (PLPs) Since these programmes are mainly to strengthen and build on basic literacy skills the most appropriate delivery systems will have some features in common with those for literacy training activities as covered by ATLP. In addition, however, the approach taken and the resources required should cater for individual differences and should promote self-initiated learning, self-pacing and reduced dependency on formal teaching. In the checklist below contact sessions, self-learning and distance learning are noted as possible delivery systems. In the case of the contact sessions it is important to stress that the methods must be appropriate for the clientele and for the purpose of the programme. For example, face-to-face sessions should not involve conventional «from the front» teaching but should be based on group activities, peer tutoring, supervised self-paced learning and so on. Most of the activities in the types of programmes are highly structured and are usually, but not always, the responsibility of formal or non-formal education. I. CHECKLIST FOR POST-LITERACY PROMOTION PROGRAMMES 1.1 INTENDED FOR: 1.2 WHO GENERALLY: 1.1.1 People only basically literate 1.2.1 Lack advanced reading skills 1.1.2 School dropouts 1.2.2 Are disadvantaged/ unemployed 1.1.3 Semi-literates 1.2.3 Belong to low income groups 67 1.3 DELIVERY SYSTEMS 1.4 RESOURCES NEEDED 1.3.1 Contact session 1.4.1 Graded/programmed (Face-to-face) learning materials 1.3.2 Self-learning 1.4.2 Teachers/Tutors/Facilitators 1.3.3 Distance Learning 1.4.3 Support learning facilities and equipment 1.3.4 Mixed approach i.e. 1.4.4 Mastery tests combinations of 1.3.1 to 1.3.3 1.4.5 Multi-media materials 1.4.6 Diagnostic materials 1.4.7 Individualized records C. Equivalency Programmes (EPs) Equivalency programmes form a somewhat specialized category of continuing education since they generally seek the same types of outcomes as the formal system but do so by alternative means. In some countries, equivalency programmes are thought of very flexibly to include alternative ways of obtaining any form of certification or accreditation within the formal non-formal or even the informal subsectors. In other countries they are limited to alternative ways of achieving a specified level of formal education only. Some equivalency programmes therefore are very broad in scope and others may be confined to only one subsector. An example of a single subsector equivalency programme, in this case the university subsector, is the system of «life» credits allowed by a particular network of colleges in the United States. In this example work in the informal subsector receives credit for degrees and diplomas awarded by the formal subsector. Probably the most common types of equivalency programmes however are those which provide alternatives to formal primary and secondary schooling. II. CHECKLIST FOR EQUIVALENCY PROGRAMMES 2.1 INTENDED FOR : 2.2 WHO GENERALLY : 2.1.1 Literate adults seeking 2.2.1 Are employed formal qualifications by alternative means 2.2.2 Are out-of-school youths/ adults 2.1.2 Primary school graduates 2.2.3 Are ambitious and selfmotivated 68 2.1.3 High scholl dropouts 2.2.4 Are seeking accreditation for employment and/or promotion 2.2.5 Cannot or are unwilling to attend formal education 2.3 DELIVERY SYSTEMS 2.4 RESOURCES NEEDED 2.3.1 Contact session 2.4.1 Graded/programmed (Face-to-face) learning materials 2.3.2 Self-learning 2.4.2 Teachers/tutors/facilitators 2.3.3 Distance learning 2.4.3 Learning support facilities and equipment 2.3.4 Counselling programmes 2.4.4 Mastery tests 2.3.5 Mixed approach, i.e. combinations 2.4.5 Multi-media materials of 2.3.1 to 2.3.4 2.4.6 Diagnostic materials 2.4.7 Individualized records 2.4.8 Standardized tests 2.4.9 Acceptance certificates 2.4.10 Certification body/authority 2.4.11 Curriculum materials for specific equivalency programmes or courses of study 2.4.13 Guidance and counselling materials D. Income-Generating Programmes (IGPs) Delivery systems for these types of programmes are very varied and can be provided through the formal, non-formal and informal subsectors. Certainly most of the activities would be self initiated with the learning objectives set by individual participants. An important dimension, however, is the need to support the programme by a good counselling and advisory service. Advocacy is also important and field CE consultants should be alert to identify potential providers 69 and to encourage participation by individuals seeking to generate income. III. CHECKLIST FOR INCOME-GENERATING PROGRAMMES 3.1 INTENDED FOR : 3.2 WHO GENERALLY 3.1.1 Employed, seeking extra 3.2.1 Are youths and adults at income or self-fulfillment varying levels of literacy with specific interests/needs 3.1.2 Prospective entrepreneurs 3.2.2 Are highly motivated to improve their life situations 3.1.3 Those seeking re-training or alternative jobs 3.1.4 Specific groups seeking extra or basic income, e.g. women, housewives, unemployed, students/dropouts, minority groups; handicaped, etc. 3.1.5 Members of co-operatives 3.3 DELIVERY SYSTEMS 3.4 RESOURCES NEEDED 3.3.1 Contact sessions (Face-to-face) 3.4.1 Outputs/products of IGPs 3.3.2 Self-learning 3.4.2 Facilities/tools/equipment 3.3.3 Distance learning 3.4.3 Raw materials 3.3.4 Mixed approaches of 3.3.1 to 3.3.3 3.4.4 Expertise/resources 3.3.5 Apprenticeship programmes 3.4.5 Training materials 3.3.6 Workshops 3.4.6 Individual logbook/diaries 3.3.7 Interest groups 3.4.7 Local case studies 3.3.8 Hobby groups 3.4.8 Information on changing world of work 3.3.9 «Sandwich» courses 3.4.9 Resources for managing 3.3.10 Study tours/visits income wisely 3.3.11 On-the-job training 3.3.12 Guidance and counselling 70 3.3.13 Co-operative programmes 3.3.14 Exhibitions/fairs 3.3.15 Project-based learning 3.3.16 Sheltered workshops for the handicapped 3.3.17 Entrepreneurship training E. Quality of Life Improvement Programmes (QLIPs) Since the focus in these types of programme is on upgrading the living standards and life styles of all citizens to at least an acceptable level of development, the clientele obviously includes all youth and adults. A key aspect is that the scope of the programme, the types of delivery systems and the resources provided should be consistent with national development plans. The programme should penetrate all levels and all subsectors of the community. Every citizen should have ready access and this implies the development of local community based delivery points and of varied activities to satisfy the needs of all categories of society. IV. CHECKLIST FOR QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMMES 4.1 INTENDED FOR 4.2 WHO GENERALLY 4.1.1 All youths and adults 4.2.1 Are literate? in developing societies 4.2.2 Include categories of people with specials needs in relation to development plans. 4.3 DELIVERY SYSTEMS 4.4 RESOURCES NEEDED As in 1.3 but delivered through the following: 4.3.1 Community development 4.4.1 Appropriate reading materials actions/approaches 4.3.2 Campaigns for improved living 4.4.2 Mass media 4.3.3 Cultural activities 4.4.3 Community groups 4.3.4 Networks of community 4.4.4 National development consultants plans/programmes 4.3.5 Contests and competitions 4.4.5 Religious institutions 71 4.3.6 Learning Centres 4.4.6 Reading centres, libraries, community halls, and so on 4.4.7 Ideal models of lifestyle and standards F. Individual Interest Programmes (llPs) In many respects programmes which cater for the individual interests of adults and which promote their personal development should be the main core of any system of continuing education. Personal development and the development and interests should occur throughout life. Because the activities under this programme, and hence the clientele, delivery systems and resources, are almost limitless in potential and scope, the cumulative output contributes very considerably to the overall educational development of the society and hence to its economic development. Individual interest programmes are always undertaken to meet specific learning objectives determined by the learners. Providers, on the other hand, must be sensitive and responsive to patterns of interest in the community and be willing to offer what participants need and want. V. CHECKLIST FOR INDIVIDUAL INTEREST PROGRAMMES 5.1 INTENDED FOR 5.2 WHO GENERALLY 5.1.1 All youths and adults 5.2.1 Are literate 5.2.2 Are specifically motivated 5.3 DELIVERY SYSTEMS 5.4 RESOURCES 5.3.1 All types 5.4.1 According to individual interests and wants G. Future Oriented Programmes (FOs) While all activities under continuing education cause change (growth) in individuals, groups and organisations and in society as a whole and therefore have a future orientation, special programmes should be provided which focus on the nature, agencies and processes of change itself. Their aim should be to facilitate planned change for a better world. The main clientele are therefore those needing to change or are involved in change or who are in a position to affect change. The delivery systems should have a future perspective and orientation and the resources needed should be forward looking. Future oriented programmes could be provided by the formal, non-formal and informal subsectors but the latter probably has a major role. Activities could be structured or unstructured and structured activities could be either self or provider initiated. 72 Future oriented programmes have a key role to play in both human resource development and economic development as they provide inputs which ensure meaningful and effective growth.VI. CHECKLIST FOR FUTURE ORIENTED PROGRAMMES 6.1 INTENDED FOR 6.2 WHO GENERALLY 6.1.1 All youths and adults 6.2.1 Are literate 6.1.2 Organizations and institutions 6.2.2 Have a scientific attitude 6.1.3 Publishers and other 6.2.3 Include individuals producers of communication and organizations materials needing to change or involved in change 6.1.4 Managers, planners 6.2.4 Have leadership ` community leaders potential 6.1.5 Change agents 6.3 DELIVERY SYSTEMS 6.4 RESOURCES NEEDED 6.3.1 R & D systems 6.4.1 Products of think-tanks and of future studies 6.3.2 Seminars/comparative studies 6.4.2 Research literature 6.3.3 Information networks/ 6.4.3 Science and technology communication research centres 6.3.4 Futures study systems 6.4.4 Case study materials 6.3.5 Exchange systems 6.4.5 Satellite communication resources 6.3.6 Study visits/cross 6.4.6 Electronic media national studies resources, computers, and computers software 6.3.7 Expositions 6.4.7 Arts and cultural centres 6.3.8 Computer systems 6.4.8 Museums 6.3.9 Industrial/commercial 6.4.9 Mass media training systems 73

﻿Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Carlos Vargas Tamez Abstract: The role of higher education in promoting economic growth and social cohesion has been recognised in multiple international documents, programmes and strategies. Likewise, a number of countries and higher education institutions worldwide have introduced policies that aim at fostering learners’ employability, active citizenship, personal development, knowledge base, competences and capabilities. However, not all these policies have successfully addressed current global trends like the economic downturn, demographic change, the changing nature of the labour market, and pressing social needs. This paper posits that introducing lifelong learning principles to the formulation and implementation of higher education policies may provide more inclusive and comprehensive frameworks for meeting the needs and aspirations of the multiple stakeholders of higher education. Keywords: Higher education; learners; education policy; lifelong learning; learning organisations. I. Introduction At the turn of the twenty-first century, different governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations and international agencies have produced a vast array of studies on the kind of higher education required to address current and future social, economic, cultural, and environmental challenges. International organisations have been particularly keen to explore and suggest initiatives by means of international summits (e.g. UNESCO), reform agendas (e.g. World Bank), the assessment of learning outcomes (e.g. the OECD), and the construction of comparable, compatible, and coherent higher education systems (e.g. the European Higher Education Area, and the Bologna Process championed by the European Commission). These initiatives reveal that the challenges which higher education must confront are pervasive and pressing, and compounded by an increasingly unfavourable economic environment. They come from international organisations which are vastly different and whose proposals range from the privatisation, deregulation, and marketization of higher education, to seeing the latter as a public good and a human right. However different their conceptualisations of HE might be, they all agree that HE is the responsibility 91 Tuning Journal for Higher Education © University of Deusto. ISSN: 2340-8170. Volume 2, Issue No. 1, November 2014, 91-105 Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas of all stakeholders, and that greater funding and efficiency is needed to promote equity and quality in and through HE. In the economic domain, HE must face a paradigm shift: the transition from industrial capitalism, in which economic growth was based on trade, to knowledge-based economies in which innovation is considered the key to economic and social development. HE, thus, plays an increasingly important role in the development of learning societies, and in addressing the transformations undergone by both the economic system and the social order. In order to respond to current economic and social imperatives, higher education systems must simultaneously develop competencies for employment, innovation and entrepreneurship (economically valuable skills), and capabilities for democracy, active citizenship, and personal development aiming at promoting social cohesion and more just and egalitarian societies. In today’s global society, the effectiveness of HE systems to develop such complex competencies has been questioned. The traditional higher education model, rooted in academic tradition and coined for industrial societies -and often driven by teaching and testing rather than learninghas arguably produced limited results in the provision of quality HE for all population groups. Indeed, there is strong evidence to suggest that HE actually widens and reproduces socioeconomic inequalities and leads to skills mismatches.1 It has been argued that HE has not been successful enough in catching-up with the emergence of new competencies, attitudes and values that are currently rendered as fundamental capabilities of individuals and society at large. It is likely that HE systems will continue to be a key for the accomplishment and satisfaction of individual and collective needs as they carry out a duty that no other institution can currently replicate. It therefore becomes imperative to explore paths towards the innovation and reform of such systems. Reform efforts have been undertaken in most countries, and many good examples can be drawn from the diverse contexts, intentions, rationalities and structures. For 1 Cf.

Volume 2, Issue No. 1, November 2014, 91-105 Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas example, recent research on the internationalisation of HE; its outcomes and effects on social mobility; the triple helix; the access to, and efficiency of HE, has shed some light on fruitful areas of analysis. These include higher education policy, pedagogy, curriculum, assessment, infrastructure, teacher training and development, funding and financing, social inclusion, and stakeholder participation. Despite this great variety of issues, this paper argues that, in pursuing greater relevance, HE policy could benefit from a wider frame for analysis — that of lifelong learningand from the lessons derived from reforms and innovations taking place worldwide. Thus, it is suggested that HEIs become learning — and not only teachingorganisations. II. Lifelong Learning and HE Lifelong Learning (LLL) is not a new phenomenon. It has been present in education history for almost a century. Its roots can be traced back to the 1920s and 30s when LLL was only about education and training opportunities for adults, particularly for workers. Half a century later, the concept of education permanent reconfigured the idea of LLL and introduced a few more features into its definition: that learning takes place throughout life, that it includes diverse sectors and social groups, that it takes place in different settings (i.e. formal, non-formal and informal), and that it aims at fulfilling a great variety of social, economic, and cultural purposes. Since then, LLL has become an important part of educational discourse throughout the world, an emerging field of study and practice, and a flagship for the formulation of education policy worldwide. Just like it has been the case with HE, different international organizations (e.g. UNESCO, OCDE, World Bank, European Commission) have stressed the role of LLL as prerequisite for economic growth and social cohesion. Such emphasis, and the level of influence these agencies have upon global education policy, has contributed to the visibility and thrust of LLL in educational debates. These transnational organizations also present different definitions of LLL; however, they all agree that it is an approach that contributes towards the adaptation to and participation of individuals to knowledge societies. There seems to be an economic rationale behind this conceptualization of LLL, that of the transition from industrial capitalism (based on the production and exchange of goods and services) to a new form of capitalism based on innovation and knowledge intensive economies. In this order of things, education and learning, and specially LLL, play a fundamental role inasmuch as they foster knowledge production and promote creativity as necessary supports for innovation and, hence, economic life.

Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas However strong this conceptualisation of LLL might be, there are other views that question and are critical of the economic impetus conferred to LLL. These alternative views assert that LLL must go beyond economic preoccupations and that education and learning must contemplate other, equally important, social and cultural purposes such as building -and living together inmore egalitarian societies, and developing critical thinking to transform social reality. In any case, and despite these differences in their conceptualization of LLL, international organizations and academic developments converge in a few distinctive features of LLL: that LLL is about placing learners, their needs, aspirations, and demands, at the centre of educational methods, programmes and policies, and that LLL must prepare individuals and societies to face a world that is constantly changing; to adapt to it and/or to transform it. These are some of the characteristics of LLL that may help inform HE policies if they are to have a positive impact upon learners and societies. HE as part of LLL must address a great variety of educational topics that concern an equally varied number of audiences and target groups. In order to do so, HE might benefit from the adoption of LLL as an organising principle. This entails embracing a number of characteristics; namely, that there is a multiplicity of settings and environments in which learning occurs; the autonomy and agency of learners; and universal participation. The first characteristic is the acknowledgement that HE might benefit from expanding its traditional settings and environments by recognizing that, besides schooling and formal training, individuals develop skills, knowledge and values in their everyday lives and through the use of other educational supports, like the family, neighbourhood, work, leisure, the media, libraries, etc. Not only could HEI benefit from the learning taking place in informal and non-formal settings, but could make use of these environments to carry out teaching, learning, and outreach activities that might enhance the relevance and outcomes of HE. This implies also recognizing, validating and accrediting the skills and knowledge that learners have acquired elsewhere, and which are valuable for the purpose of HE programmes. The second characteristic concerns respecting and enhancing the autonomy and agency of learners. This includes on the one hand, placing learners’ needs and concerns at the centre of curriculum, delivery and assessment methods, and making students responsible for their own learning. Lifelong learners are not defined by the kind of education or training in which they take part, but rather by personal traits that drive them to partake in learning opportunities. According to Nesbit, Dunlop, and 94 Tuning Journal for Higher Education © University of Deusto. ISSN: 2340-8170. Volume 2, Issue No. 1, November 2014, 91-105 Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas Gibson,2 the individuals who are prone to participate in either formal or informal learning processes throughout life share a few traits among which are: the right attitude and skills for learning; the confidence to learn and to keep learning, including a sense of commitment towards education and learning; and the will and motivation to learn. Although education and training, and especially HE, may result in economic benefits for learners, research has demonstrated that economic incentives alone might not be enough to motivate individuals to get involved in education.3 A number of barriers -motivational, economic, and otherwisemust be indentified and addressed so that some individuals who don’t usually participate in education may be able to do so. Some of these obstacles are economic and can thus be surmounted by means of financial assistance, but other dissuasive factors are social, cultural and personal in nature. That is the case of the so-called non-traditional students in HE; learners whose age, background, social and cultural capitals, and the social construction and stigmas behind being a non-traditional student, might inhibit them from taking part in HE. The relevance of HE provision is also an issue that concerns individual motivation, or lack thereof, to enroll a given HE programme. Identifying the obstacles faced by different social groups to enter and benefit from HE is the first step towards universal participation. The third characteristic is precisely that of universal participation; that is, the possibility that all social groups regardless of their ethnic, socioeconomic, cultural, religious, sexual, physical, age, or gender conditions may be able to participate in HE. Likewise, a HEI that welcomes and promotes participation from diverse groups should be able to cover the social, economic, and personal goals that these groups attach to HE. The massification of HE, and the response that HE systems have chosen to give to this phenomenon, based on competition dynamics, have meant the systematic exclusion of society’s most disadvantaged groups from HE. These include adults but also youth from low-income families, people with disabilities, racial minorities, indigenous groups, immigrants, and women. 2 Tom Nesbit, Catherine Dunlop, and Lorraine Gibson, “Lifelong Learning in Institutions of Higher Education,” Canadian Journal of University Continuing Education 33, no 1 (2007): 35-60.3 Cf.

Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas Whereas there are measures to monitor the progress of HEI regarding their quality and excellence (e.g. rankings, and performance indicators), these have not yet been developed to assess the efforts that HEI undergo in order to provide fairer and more inclusive access and progression to underserved societal groups. As explained by Usher: It is difficult to understand what kind of progress is being made internationally in this quest for ‘fairness’ or ‘equity’ in participation, for the simple reason that there is not an international standard for measuring it and difference countries have chosen to try to capture the issue in very different ways. In America, the unit of measurement for equality of participation is usually race, though family income is used as well. In the UK, measures of ‘class’ predominate. In much of Europe, there are concerns about the participation rates of recent immigrants, but administrative or survey data that can measure participation rates of these groups is quite limited. About a decade ago, however, the Eurostudent project began publishing a comparison of equality based on parental education levels — a measure which was later dubbed the ‘Education Equity Index’ and brought into use in comparisons involving non-European OECD countries. This data is somewhat patchy (no data is available in many countries) and cannot — as yet — tell us anything about changes over time as it has not been collected for very long. It can, however, show some basic differences in equality of access across different systems.4 In short, applying the principles of LLL to HE policy encompasses: • Awareness of the fact that valuable learning takes place beyond HEI, and of the ample possibilities these other environments offer for HE; • Understanding learning as a continuous need of individuals throughout their lives, and of the contributions HE can make in this respect; • Acknowledging that contemporary societies need more than formal education to deal with constant local and global changes; • Recognising that a learning society — and a learning organisation — are better alternatives to deal with such changes; and • Admitting that both individuals and their communities need to be involved in determining learning needs and goals, and that they should do so throughout life. 4 Alex Usher, “Ten Years Back and Ten Years Forward: Development and Trends in Higher Education in Europe” (paper presented at the UNESCO Forum on Higher Education in the Europe Region: Access, Values, Quality and Competitiveness, Bucharest, Romania, May 21-24, 2009): 7. 96 Tuning Journal for Higher Education © University of Deusto. ISSN: 2340-8170. Volume 2, Issue No. 1, November 2014, 91-105 Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas Evidently, these principles beg for profound transformations in the way HE has traditionally been organized and structured, and the relationships of HEI with other stakeholders of HE. Among other factors, recruitment, admission, accreditation and recognition of prior learning, curricula, delivery methods and environments, assessment, quality assurance, and funding must be revised in order to orientate HE towards LLL. Perhaps the most challenging transformations have to do with how HE is conceived either as a public good or a private gain, and whose purposes HEI must seek to fulfil, those of the economy, individuals, or society at large. III. The LLL University Throughout the world, different initiatives that aim at promoting LLL among and within HEIs have been undertaken. Examples of this can be found in the Mumbai Statement on Lifelong Learning, Active Citizenship and the Reform of Higher Education (1998), which draws from the work begun at Fifth International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA V, 1997) in which a working group on Adult Education and Universities was put together. The Mumbai Statement was meant as a call for action for the delegates to the 1998 UNESCO World Conference on Higher Education, and was signed by HE and LLL experts and practitioners who proposed opening universities to adult learners and transforming HEI into LLL institutions. According to the statement, this requires a holistic approach which: a) supports institutions to become LLL communities; b) integrates academic, financial and administrative elements; c) provides structures which are responsible for organizational, staff, student and curriculum development and community engagement; and d) aligns the various supportive structures such as academic information systems, library provision and learning technologies to the new mission of universities in learning societies.5 The signatories’ main preoccupations were the societal challenges taking place due to economic globalisation, the rapid development of science, technology, and knowledge based societies that have given rise to unprecedented unemployment and inequality among nations and between countries, and tensions between social groups. Thus, the Statement recalls democratic citizenship as a key purpose of LLL and recognises that 5 “Mumbai Statement on Lifelong Learning, Active Citizenship and the Reform of Higher Education,” in Adult Education and Development 55, ed.

Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas ...democratic citizenship depends on such factors as effective economic development, attention to the demands of the least powerful in our societies, and on the impact of industrial processes on the caring capacity of our common home...The notion of citizenship is important in terms of connecting individuals and groups to the structures of social, political and economic activity in both local and global contexts. Democratic citizenship highlights the importance of women and men as agents of history in all aspects of their lives.6 While the World Conference on Higher Education (UNESCO, 1998), echoed some of the concerns posed by the Mumbai Statement; namely those regarding access and equity, and, to a lesser extent, LLL and the promotion of active citizenship, it did not provide guidelines (rather a Declaration for HE in the XXI Century) that could assist HE stakeholders in pursuing the transformations of HE. A couple of years later, the participants to a Conference on Lifelong Learning, Higher Education, and Active Citizenship held in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2000 (some of which had taken part in CONFINTEA V, The Mumbai Statement, and UNESCO’s 1998 World Conference on Higher Education), issued the Cape Town Statement on the Characteristic Elements of a Lifelong Learning Higher Education Institution (2001) as “an organisational tool to be developed further in local contexts”.7 The Cape Town Statement recollected many of the concerns developed in the preceding international fora but with a view to developing “an instrument to assist transformation within HEIs”. The Statement elaborates on six characteristic elements:8 • Overarching Frameworks, including regulatory, financial, and socio-cultural supports upon and within which to build a LLL culture in and through HEIs • Strategic Partnerships and Linkages, including international partnerships, cross-sectoral collaboration between institutions and stakeholders, and partnerships within HEIs (e.g. shared decision making, policies and strategies) • Research across disciplines, traditions, and institutions. This involves collaborative research, the recognition of a plurality of research paradigms and of the legitimacy of LLL as an area of study and practice. 6 Mumbai Statement, 3. 7 UNESCO Institute of Education, The Cape Town Statement on Characteristic Elements of a Lifelong Learning Higher Education institution (UIE, Cape Town: 2001), 2. 8 UNESCO, The Cape Town Statement, 4-7. 98 Tuning Journal for Higher Education © University of Deusto. ISSN: 2340-8170. Volume 2, Issue No. 1, November 2014, 91-105 Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas • The Teaching and Learning Process by which educators encourage self-directed learning, engage with the different forms of knowledge, interests, and life situations which learners bring to their education, and promote autonomous and experiential learning approaches and opportunities. • Administration Policies and Mechanisms which put learners and their learning processes at the centre of all processes. This includes, for example, prior learning recognition and accreditation, and the flexibility of programmes, courses and formats that may enable learners to choose, to move between offers, and to build their own learning paths. • Student Support Systems and Services, including those supporting learning, and enabling conditions for learning (e.g. costs, financial aid, childcare, transport, accessibility) Although some 95 people from 19 different countries attended and subscribed the Cape Town Statement, and despite the fact that it was supported and published by the then UNESCO Institute of Education, it is not clear to what extent it has been used in reforming HEI or systems around the globe. Documented cases include the University of the Western Cape, South Africa (host to the Conference that gave birth to the Statement) which developed LLL strategies, including an on-going policy for the recognition of prior learning; the University of Missouri (USA) whose collaboration with the latter included the ideation of measurable performance indicators for the characteristic elements of a LLL HEI; and Chulalongkorn University in Thailand which adopted lifelong education as an institutional paradigm.9 At a regional level, a more recent example can be seen in the European Universities’ Charter on Lifelong Learning (EUA, 2008). Derived from a seminar on LLL held in Paris, and by invitation of the then French Prime Minister, the EUA developed a set of commitments that both universities and governments need to subscribe if they are to transform HEI into lifelong learning institutions. The commitments made by universities entail promoting and embedding LLL as an organising principle of HE; providing education and learning to a diversified student population; adapt study programmes to widen participation and attract adult learners; providing guidance and counselling services; recognising prior learning; developing internal quality 9 Hohn Henschke, “Common Elements for Re-Orienting Higher education Institutions in Various Countries toward Lifelong Learning: Research and Implications for Practice” (paper presented at the Midwest Research-to-Practice Conference in Adult, Continuing, Extension, and Community Education.

Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas culture; strengthening the relationships between research, teaching, and innovation in a LLL perspective; consolidating reforms to promote flexible and creative environments for all learners; developing partnerships at all levels to increase the relevance of HE; and becoming LLL role models for inside and outside stakeholders.10 While it acknowledges the role of HEI in promoting LLL, the Charter recognises that these transformations demand actions from governments and other partners in order to secure the necessary funding and appropriate legal and institutional frameworks. Among these are: “recognising the university contribution to lifelong learning as major benefit to individuals and societies; promoting social equity and inclusive learning in society; supporting guidance and counselling services”.11 The Charter also states that governments need to play a leading role in mainstreaming LLL in the systems and agencies in charge of quality assurance, recognition, validation and accreditation of prior learning, and should remove legal obstacles and constraints that potential learners face in order to access LLL and HE. University autonomy in terms of admission requirements, for example, and incentives to LLL provision in HEIs is also a responsibility governments should bear according to the Charter. Finally, encouraging partnerships with local authorities, employers, and other social organisations, and informing and encouraging citizens to participate in LLL opportunities provided by HEIs is also a role governments need to perform. Like universities, governments can act as role models thus championing LLL in public policy and extending LLL opportunities for public sector employees.12 IV. Universities as Learning Organisations This paper argues that, in order to comply with the above mentioned characteristics of LLL institutions, and to fully promote LLL, universities must become learning organisations. In addition to the social considerations explained up to this point, there are financial reasons for this transformation. Given the fact that there are numerous stakeholders in HE (e.g. learners, governments, enterprises), and that they present a multiplicity of needs, HEI may transform themselves into providers of learning opportunities and research outcomes that aim at solving problems and satisfying the personal, 10 European University Association, European University Charter on Lifelong Learning (Brussels: EUA, 2008), 5-7. 11 EUA, European University Charter, 8. 12 EUA, European University Charter, 9-10. 100 Tuning Journal for Higher Education © University of Deusto. ISSN: 2340-8170. Volume 2, Issue No. 1, November 2014, 91-105 Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas social, and professional demands for education and training presented by different sectors, thus diversifying their sources of funding. According to some authors13 the university’s mission to produce and organise advanced knowledge has been challenged by the knowledge economy, and newer demands have emerged from government, industry, and other stakeholders. Likewise, these authors recognise that the production and organisation of knowledge, and its use in addressing public and private concerns escapes the sole academic spectrum. Every time more, the university is presented with opportunities to partner with other sectors in order to undertake research and training. This way, industry, for example, can seek to address the learning needs of employees (e.g. up-skilling, re-tooling) via university LLL courses and modules, or to research education and learning solutions to private strategies together with HEIs. Likewise, the public sector may find university offers of continuous learning as a means to promote active citizenship, social inclusion, or even leisure, cultural and personal development. This cooperation between three sectors which once acted separately (i.e. university, government and industry) has been called the ‘Triple Helix’. This approach was developed by Etzkowitz14 and Leydesdorff15 as a model to promote innovation. The approach is based in the perspective of the university as a leader of the relationship with industry and government to generate new knowledge, innovation, and economic development. Innovation is understood as resulting from a complex and dynamic process of experiences and relations between science, technology, research, and development among the three sectors in a spiral of endless transitions. This approach necessarily involves learning processes for all the stakeholders engaged in the innovation process. On the one hand, the university needs to enhance its third mission (apart from teaching and research), and needs to learn different analytical frameworks to approach problems; those traditionally applied by government and industry. On the other hand, the university needs to learn how to bridge the gap between public, private, and academic concerns in order for the cross-fertilisation of ideas to work. 13 Cf.

Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas The role in innovation that HEIs are called to fulfil does not substitute their more traditional mission in educating and empowering learners, rather it provides a great opportunity for HEIs “to reassess their academic and professional beliefs, values, attitudes, and practices”,16 and to expand the latter to a range of new actors including workers and non-traditional students. This expansion, as has been mentioned, necessitates the reformulation and modification of HE systems and practices, and this is where HEIs can learn from other stakeholders. For instance by examining how learning takes place in the workplace, in informal settings, and in NGOs, or by looking at how research outcomes are utilised in the public and private sectors. Looked at it this way, “lifelong learning can represent a set of guiding principles for development, rather than an additional problem for institutions of higher education”.17 According to Nesbit and colleagues: Several studies of lifelong learning in different countries have examined how systems of higher education are changing to meet learners’ needs and, in doing so, are impacting various aspects of university governance, funding, resources, planning, and community relations...these studies indicate the extent to which the environment of higher education is changing and how such changes are redefining the character and role of institutions of higher education.18 The same authors claim that these transformations in HE are also responses to changes in public policy since “for governments, what is taught, investigated, and promoted [in HEIs] influences knowledge, attitudes, and values in many areas of society”.19 V. Implications for public policy Following these arguments, it can be deduced that LLL policies in HEIs would need to look at the research and teaching that is carried out by universities, government, and industry, and identify how these institutions cross-over, and the knowledge and the lessons that have been learned in the process of attending to a particular phenomenon should be systematised. This practice of policy learning is made easier “if clear structures and procedures are put in place so that institutional modes of ‘knowing what 16 Nesbit et al., “Lifelong Learning”, 39. 17 Nesbit et al., “Lifelong Learning”, 49. 18 Nesbit et al., “Lifelong Learning”, 38. 19 Nesbit et al., “Lifelong Learning”, 38. 102 Tuning Journal for Higher Education © University of Deusto. ISSN: 2340-8170. Volume 2, Issue No. 1, November 2014, 91-105 Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas works’ and ‘learning’ can be extracted, stored, reviewed and communicated”. This concerns the “...issue of how the making of public policy can be a process of organisational and public learning”.20 One challenge of evidence based policy making is that it is not related to the actual amount of evidence out there, but rather to its usage or lack thereof. Many authors have discussed that research findings are underutilised when it comes to decision making.21 For example Schön would argue that there is no shortage of evidence, information or data; rather, he maintains, the deficit has less to do with an information gap, than with our capacity for public and private learning. As put forth by Parsons: Schön focuses on the issue of learning rather than the idea of knowing: on the learning rather than the information or evidence gap, and the gap between institutions and problems [...] what follows from this is that we have to understand government and policy making as a process of learning. For Schön the answer to the question of improving government as a learning system involved radically rethinking and redesigning the policy process of increasingly more complex information societies.22 Reshaping the policy process involves the redesign of public institutions too. According to Schön “we must become adept at learning, we must be able not only to transform our institutions in response to changing situations and requirements; we must invent and develop institutions which are ‘learning systems’ that is to say capable of bringing about their own continuing transformation”.23 From this standpoint, public policy, and HE is no exception, is really the study of how societies learn (or fail to learn) about those problems they define as being public and how they seek to solve (or fail to solve) them. This is particularly true of public institutions and governments which “... should lay less stress on the dubious and doubtful claim to know what is best for a particular organisation...and should place more emphasis on organisations making the best use of local knowledge and their learning experiences”.24 20 Wayne Parsons, “From Muddling Through to Muddling UpEvidence Based Policy Making and the Modernisation of British Government,” Public Policy and Administration 17, no 3 (2002): 47. 21 Cf.

Lifelong Learning principles and higher education policies Vargas VI. Conclusion The same way that governments should learn from their surrounding institutions, including HEIs, these in turn should learn from their stakeholders, including non-traditional learners. This means that HEIs must be transformed into learning organisations so that they may be able to systematise their learning, the knowledge they produce, and share it as an important element to bring about change or the solutions needed by a particular policy object. Becoming a learning organisation means being subjected to continuous transformation and development processes, and being able to systematise and assess these transformational experiences. But most importantly, becoming a LLL organisation, means that HEIs governance structures become more horizontal, as every person is a learner within and outside the organisation. It also means the acknowledgement that HEIs can learn from other stakeholders and from their own practice, can produce knowledge together, and can put this knowledge to use for the improvement and prosperity of the societies in which they operate.

﻿Nursing Inquiry 2010; 17(4): 208–220 Feature Continuing nursing education policy in China and its impact on health equity Lily Dongxia Xiao Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia Accepted for publication 22 February 2010 XIAO LD. Nursing Inquiry 2010; 17: 208–220 Continuing nursing education policy in China and its impact on health equity The aim of this study was to evaluate the mandatory continuing nursing education (MCNE) policy in China and to examine whether or not the policy addresses health equity. MCNE was instituted in 1996 in China to support healthcare reform was to include producing greater equity in health-care. However, the literature increasingly reports inequity in participation in MCNE, which is likely to have had a detrimental effect on the pre-existing discrepancies of education in the nursing workforce, and thereby failing to really address health equity. Despite a growing appeal for change, there is lack of critical reflection on the issues of MCNE policy. Critical ethnography underpinned by Habermas’ Communicative Action Theory and Giddens’ Structuration Theory were used to guide this study. Findings are presented in four themes: (i) inaccessibility of learning programs for nurses; (ii) undervaluation of workplace-based learning; (iii) inequality of the allocation of resources; and (iv) demands for additional support in MCNE from non-tertiary hospitals. The findings strongly suggest the need for an MCNE policy review based on rational consensus with stakeholders while reflecting the principles of health equity. Key words: critical theory, health policy, inequalities in health, nurse education, professional development. 
Mandatory continuing nursing education (MCNE) was instituted in 1996 in the context of healthcare reform in China in order to meet increasing demands from the public for accessible, affordable and high-quality healthcare services (CMOH 2000). The healthcare reform, based on socialist market-oriented healthcare services, was started in the 1990s during which healthcare organizations were developed into self-sustaining organizations largely initiated by means of competition in the provision of health services (Bloom and Gu 1997; Liu, Hsiao, and Eggleston 1999). However, after more than a decade-long trial of the reform, there was a realization that it had failed, with the failure mainly attributable to the growing health inequity between the rural and urban areas (World Bank 2005; Gao 2006). Meanwhile the literature relating to MCNE increasingly reports unequal learning opportunities, unequal distribution of learning resources and learning coercion (Edwards, Zhou, and Song 2001; Chen and Wu 2005), which may ultimately enlarge theses existing nursing workforce discrepancies between the rural and urban areas and therefore contribute to maintaining, or even increasing health inequity. Although China has made a great effort to reduce poverty since the economic reform of the 1980s, it still has ‘the second largest concentration of extreme poor in the world’ after India, with the majority of the poorest population living in rural areas (World Bank 2009, 17). A body of evidence shows that ‘the poorest of the poor, around the world, have the worst health’ (CSDH 2008, 31). Therefore, closing the health gap requires a government’s action. Nurses play a key role in delivering primary care and are therefore most likely to be prepared to combat povertyCorrespondence: Lily Dongxia Xiao, PhD, RN, MRCN, Lecturer in Nursing, School related diseases and health issues.

METHOD The aim of this study was to evaluate MCNE policy in China and to examine whether it is conducive to health equity. As the review of Chinese literature revealed, policy development was formed by means of a highly centralized, government-based policy process, Habermas’ Communicative Action Theory and Giddens’ Structuration Theory were applied to inform the theoretical framework guiding the practice of critical ethnography. These theories concentrate on analyzing how ideology, power and social structures either enable or inhibit social practice. The methods used were field-based study with multiple approaches for data collection, consisting of in-depth interviews, participant observation, informal conversations with program participants and a two-round Delphi study. Theoretical underpinnings A fundamental difference between interpretative ethnography and critical ethnography is that the former tries to reconstruct actors’ own world-views in their everyday lives through a field study, whereas the latter moves further to critique how ideology, power and social structures contribute to the actors’ views and practice (Carspecken 1996). A theoretical framework that builds on critical theories provides a lens to enable the researcher to consider the truth and justice underlying social practice. In this study, the theoretical framework is an integration of Giddens’ Structuration Theory and Habermas’ Communicative Action Theory. Social structure as used in Giddens’ Structuration Theory refers to ‘rules and resources’ associated with the exercise of power over people’s actions (Giddens 1984, 25). The rules in the theory are either formal (laws and legislation) or informal (tactical norms or formulae). Resources are divided into allocative and authoritative resources, with the former concerned with the material resources used to control nature, and the latter concerned with the capability of harnessing human activities. Social structures and people’s actions are not separated as ‘a dualism’, but are ‘a duality’, inseparable and shaping each other (Giddens 1984, 25). Structures enable the channeling of people’s actions in a specific manner, but, however, may also constrain people’s rationality. Therefore, the outcome of peoples’ actions will include both ‘intended consequences’ and ‘unintended consequences’. Conversely, this theory acknowledges that people have the capability, generated from a ‘reflexive form of knowledgeability’ (p. 3) to modify structures in order to improve practice. Figure 1 was developed to demonstrate the ‘duality’ relationship via means of human reflexive circles. This theory can be transferred into empirical research to examine the rules and resources set in MCNE policy, which may either enable or inhibit people’s practices through the ‘double hermeneutic of social life’ (Morrow and Brown 1994, 156): that is, the participants’ perception of the rules and resources with a fusion of the participant’s and the researcher’s perceptions. In this study, such a ‘double hermeneutic’ occurred after two rounds of Delphi study: consisting of in-depth interviews and participant observation. Structuration Theory, however, focuses mainly on the conditions of material and human capability in social practice, though with less orientation to ideology and the relations of power embedded in these conditions. Habermas believes that the unique nature of human beings as both toolmakers and language users ensures that social labor occurs under both conditions, that is, in terms of manipulating nature in the material world and communicative action in the life-world (Habermas 1972). Communicative action based on an ideal speech situation is an emancipatory form by which ‘the organization of society is linked to decision-making processes on the basis of discussion free from domination’ (Habermas 1972, 55). Communicative action is described as action aimed at reaching understanding, and is therefore the fundamental process by which to reach a rational consensus (Habermas 1979). This theory acknowledges the impact of ideology, power relations and conflict of interest on social practice. This theory can be applied to analyze how ideology and power relations impact on policy formulation and implementation. In order to reach a rational consensus for changes in MCNE based on health equity, it also informed the design of egalitarian dialog with the key stakeholders in this study. Communicative Action Theory, however, is criticized as being too utopian to be conducted in an ideological asymmetric society where ideological domination is unavoidable (Held 1980; Giddens 1984). When combined with Structuration Theory, this study (see figure 1) demonstrates the extent to which it overcame such weaknesses by producing evidence associated with the rules and resources that usually sustain ideological domination and power relations in MCNE policy development. Ideological critique Communicative action based on critical reflection and recommended changes Modify Structures (rules and Enable People’s resources), action = Unintended consequences + Intended consequences ideologies and power Inhibit Figure 1 Research design based on Structuration Theory and Communicative Action Theory Ó 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd 211 Continuing nursing education in China 
Research design Critical ethnography is developed by using interpretive ethnography with the use of multiple data collection methods through a field study. This methodology adopts a bottom-up approach to policy evaluation to reveal an aspect of the socially and politically constructed nature of the inequity in MCNE and its fundamental impact on the healthcare system. Methods used to collect data were via means of a 5-month field study in six CNE programs in China, and included observation, in-depth interviews, document analysis, informal discussions in five programs and the researcher’s reflective journals (see table 4). All participants in the study were Chinese speakers; and the researcher, who is bilingual Chinese and English and was a nurse educator in China before this study, used Chinese during data collection and translated data from Chinese to English after collection. A two-round Delphi study was conducted to engage a group of nurse leaders in discussing the issues and their perspectives on the policy changes in MCNE. The ethics committee of the university, within which the researcher was enrolled for PhD study, and the Chinese Minister of Health (CMOH) approved this study. Free informed consent was obtained before both observation and interviews. Anonymity was assured, given the context in which free speech on Chinese government policy still remains quite sensitive, even within the context of study. Using five-point Likert scale questionnaires and open-ended questions, the first round of the Delphi study was conducted before fieldwork in the six Chinese venues of the CNE programs. The questions were mainly generated from a literature review and were not specific to individual problems (see examples in table 5). The issues of concern identified in the first round of the Delphi study were further explored in the six venues of the programs, and in the second round of the Delphi study. A purposive sample of 40 nurse leaders was approached by mail with forms returned by 22 of those in the first round. Participants for the Delphi study were selected through the CMOH website of approved national-level program providers, and through informants. The response rate was 55%. These participants represented provinces of north, south, east and southwest of China. Demographic information about the participants in the Delphi study is provided in table 6. The second round of the Delphi study was conducted once the researcher had completed the field study. The researcher analyzed the data from the first round of Delphi study, and the major issues identified from the six venues of CNE programs. These results were presented for participants when conducting the second round of Delphi study. The second round of the Delphi study mainly comprised open-ended questions in which participants were encouraged to recommend changes to MCNE (see table 7).

In the field study, 10 program providers were invited to participate via means of a letter of invitation. Six program providers responded to the invitation and were contacted to arrange the researcher’s participation in these programs and research activities. These programs consisted of a nationallevel web-based MCNE program, two national-level MCNE programs, a provincial-level MCNE program and two hospital-level MCNE programs. The venues of the six programs crossed north, southwest and south of China. The web-based program was available for participants across China over the space of a year, and the researcher interviewed only the program providers. National and provincial programs were 5-day programs. The researcher participated in these programs and stayed in hotels where the program participants also resided. Through close contact with program participants in these accommodation venues, the researcher was able to discuss issues with them in quite an informal manner. The researcher participated in the two hospital-level programs, examined documents pertinent to MCNE and had informal discussions with the directors of nursing who took charge of MCNE. Six program providers and five program participants from these selected programs were formally interviewed, using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The research activities are summarized in table 4. Data analysis and interpretation were carried out through three steps informed by the theoretical framework built into this study: Step 1: identifying factors that contradict equal working force development and health equity as described by participants; Step 2: critiquing rules and resource distribution that either enable or inhibit equal nursing workforce development and health equity by the means of MCNE, based on Ó 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd 213 Continuing nursing education in China dialogs with participants and by applying Structuration Theory to guide the dialogs; Step 3: critiquing the power and ideology that legitimate rules and resource distribution that fail to address equity in MCNE and health equity; then exploring changes in MCNE that address equal nursing workforce development and health equity, by applying Communicative Action Theory. Thematic analysis was applied to the interview data and open-ended questions from the Delphi study. Descriptive statistics were applied to summarize the quantitative data from round 1 of Delphi study using PASW statistics 17 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Findings from the three-step analysis were synthesized and presented as themes in a coherent manner. Rigor Critical research is viewed as rigorous when the research can generate catalytic validity for changes (Lather 1991). Catalytic validity is defined as ‘the degree to which the research process re-orients, focuses and energizes participants towards knowing reality in order to transform it’ (Lather 1991, 68). Rigor in this study was demonstrated through egalitarian dialogs with key stakeholders about issues of concern and rational consensus on how to improve MCNE. It was anticipated that they might either advocate policy changes or make some positive changes in MCNE in the future. In addition, on the completion of this study, the researcher was invited to present major findings from this study at a national conference focusing on nursing education. As the majority of participants in the conference were nurse leaders, the researcher hoped that the presentation might facilitate further discussions about the improvement of MCNE policy in the future.

A lack of research on developing competence standards impedes the exploration of relevant programs for nurses regarding their level of practice and specialties FINDINGS Generally, participants in the Delphi study gave relatively low scores to the MCNE relating to the development of crucial abilities in patient care, and showing some concern relating to issues arising from the first round of Delphi study. These were clarified in the six venues of programs (see table 4). Findings are a synthesis of the three-step analysis and are presented as four themes: (1) inaccessibility of learning programs for nurses, (2) undervaluation of workplace-based learning, (3) inequality of the allocation of resources, and 214 Ó 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd LD Xiao (4) demands for additional support in MCNE from nontertiary hospitals. Inaccessibility of learning programs for nurses Although the MCNE policy set detailed credit requirements for re-licensure, these requirements were modified due to the failure, by most nurses, to achieve them. Even RNs employed by richly resourced tertiary hospitals are unable to meet the required Type 1 credits, as a nursing administrator explained: Most nurses in my hospital cannot gain study leave and financial support to attend Type 1 programs. We never

audit the type of credit, but accept the total of 25 credits from any type of program for re-licensure. (Fieldwork [F]2, Participant [P]2) I spoke with program participants on an informal basis, confirming that only the total of the 25 credits, and not a proportion of either Type 1 or Type 2 credits, could be used for re-licensure, promotion and renewal of contracts. Participants in the Delphi study (see Table 4) were also concerned about the non-compliance with MCNE policy. Such amendments are evidence of pragmatic resistance by stakeholders to the unachievable credit requirements. However, there has been neither investigation of the actual conditions for re-licensure, nor reflection on this amendment during the entire 10 years of MCNE. A disconnection between policy formulation, implementation and evaluation was evident, and continues to contribute to unresolved problems in MCNE. Even in a capital city, the supply of programs is insufficient, so RNs have little choice but to attend the programs available for them, as explained by a nursing administrator: The Nursing Association in the city allows nurses to buy a card to attend programs to gain credits. Another option is to enrol in online programs. According to their [nurses’] attendance record, it is not unusual that they attended similar programs twice a year for meeting credit requirements, or programs which are not relevant to their practice. (F5, P1) This case indicates the learning coercion that threatens the entire ‘competency’ purpose of MCNE. Such situations were even worse in non-tertiary hospitals, as revealed in an interview with a nursing administrator from a secondary hospital: Meeting credit requirements is one of the necessary conditions to pass the annual appraisal for promotion and renewal of contract ... We have received complaints that some nurses have enrolled in a program without actually attending the program ... It would be unfair if we punish them as we do not give them study leave, nor do we provide any program. (F6, P3) Owing to social sanctions, ordinary RNs had little ability to change the way they learnt. Their passive behavior in giving silent, pragmatic consent to unachievable credit requirements by buying credit or by repetition of programs simply for the credit best represents their coping strategies in their professional lives. Confronting such a situation does not require further coercion to be imposed on these ‘autonomous nurses’, but rather they should be relieved from it by viewing them as ‘masters of their own learning’. These examples clearly reveal that rules in terms of Type 1 and Type 2 credit requirements are unachievable due to the lack of support by other stakeholders (healthcare organizations in this case) and through inadequate resources. Developing such an unachievable policy and failing to amend the rules through evaluation in more than a decade are evidence of the government’s ideology-based policy decision-making mediated by administrative power, with so little action taken to validate such an ideology. Undervaluation of workplace-based learning Participants clearly described the value of workplace-based learning, in linking learning with practice, and felt frustrated by their ‘unrecognized’ learning in secondary hospitals: I gained my expertise in diabetic nursing care through ward-based learning. It is the best way to gain knowledge when the learning group has similar learning needs. We can always apply what we learn to patient care and make

Unfortunately, these activities do not gain any credits because secondary of the allocation of resources hospitals have no jurisdiction for providing programs.

This learning approach is endorsed by healthcare organizations, as stated in another interview with a nursing administrator from a secondary hospital: Observation in two of the on-site programs in fieldworks 4 and 5 (see table 3) confirmed that these programs were attended by two nursing administrators in provincial-level programs and were then re-presented in their hospitals. In order to survive marketing competition, two hospitals Indeed, a general strategy of exempting RNs from rural and merged. There are significant job changes for nurses.

As the purpose of these programs was to re-educate nurses to be competent in a new healthcare environment, both organizations and individual nurses stand to benefit from this learning approach. Participants from non-tertiary hospitals strongly suggested that this type of learning should be officially acknowledged by the MCNE policy. These examples clearly show that the rule, in terms of giving only tertiary hospitals the jurisdiction to provide Type 2 programs, suppressed any development interests that non-tertiary healthcare organizations may have had, and their nurses’ genuine interests in undertaking competency Historically, there is a huge gap in health services between rural and urban areas in China due to long-term lower investment in health-care in rural areas, and also owing to little or no medical cover or welfare for peasants. Delivering additional resources in MCNE in these areas is one way to develop more equitable health-care. Unequal learning opportunities were identified as the consequence of lack of strategies to ensure that every RN has access to basic resources in MCNE, and the use of a marketing economic model in health service, as stated in two interviews: development in the workplace. It appeared that the nonWards with better contributions to the hospital’s revenue tertiary hospitals would have had the resources to conduct their own workplace-based learning activities.

Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 6 Introduction The mission of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies is to educate professionals in research and management of the environment and natural resources for present and future generations of people worldwide. Doctoral studies focus on a wide variety of environmental issues, many of immediate concern to policy makers and resource managers. The School offers individual programs in many areas of forestry and environmental studies, as manifested in the diverse interests and expertise of the faculty and the programs of former and present doctoral students. Two doctoral degrees are awarded: the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree conferred through the Graduate School of Yale University and the degree of Doctor of Forestry and Environmental Studies (D.F.E.S.) conferred through the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Work toward the Ph.D. degree is directed by the Department of Forestry and Environmental Studies of the Graduate School which is composed of the faculty of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. The D.F.E.S. program merged with the Ph.D. program in the 20032004 academic year. The D.F.E.S. program will continue to exist until all its current students complete the program. No additional students will be admitted to the D.F.E.S. program; new students will be admitted to the Ph.D. program. The Ph.D. program is designed to develop the broad knowledge, analytical powers, technical skills, and creative thinking demanded of leaders in natural resource disciplines. Admission to the doctoral program assumes that, in addition to an appropriate undergraduate degree, the student has a master’s degree or equivalent work or research experience. Nevertheless, depending on the norms of individual disciplines, a person may be directly accepted for doctoral work upon completion of an undergraduate degree. All courses offered by the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies are open to students working toward the doctoral degree. Courses Procedures and Policies Page 7 are available in other departments, such as Agrarian Studies, Anthropology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Chemistry, Economics, Epidemiology and Public Health, Geology, History, Mathematics, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, Management, Political Science, Sociology and Statistics. Schedules of all classes offered during a semester can be found at www.yale.edu/courseinfo immediately before the beginning of the semester. Students must take a qualifying examination before the start of the fifth semester, and no later than the end of the third year of study. This examination includes a thesis proposition that must be approved by the student’s committee. The qualifying examination is discussed in more detail later in this document. The Director of Doctoral Studies (DDS) of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies administers both doctoral programs, and may be consulted about specific problems or questions concerning either program. The material contained in this document supplements or amplifies regulations pertaining to doctoral study included in the bulletins of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Programs and Policies bulletin which can be found at this website: gsas.yale.edu/academics/ programs-policies. The student is referred to these two publications for additional information. Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 8 Course Requirements Because of the great variety of research topics pursued by doctoral students in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, just one course is required to be taken by all doctoral students: FES 900, Doctoral Student Seminar. (Doctoral Seminar will incorporate the Federally mandated course on responsible conduct of research.) During their first semester, all students should take the Doctoral Student Seminar as well as an Independent Study with their faculty advisor (at least 10 hours per week) to initiate the development of their dissertation topic. The Graduate School requires all graduate students teaching for the first time at Yale to attend a “Teaching at Yale Day” workshop offered by the Yale Center for Teaching and Learning. Students may take the workshop at the beginning of the fall or spring semester preceding their first teaching assignment. For this academic year, Teaching at Yale Day will be offered on August 27, 2018 and January 11, 2019. For more information please see ctl.yale.edu/teaching/pre-facultyprofessional-development . Students plan their academic programs in consultation with their major professor and faculty doctoral committee. Coursework is expected to be an important component of each student’s studies prior to achieving candidacy. A typical course load in the doctoral program is up to three to four courses per semester. Under normal circumstances, students are expected to achieve candidacy no later than their fourth semester in the program. A list of required courses for the combined degree with Anthropology can be found here: environment.yale.edu/doctoral/degrees/combined-anthropology. What constitutes a full-time academic program (in terms of courses, special projects, research, and so forth) is left to the discretion of the student’s doctoral committee subject to approval by the Director of Doctoral Studies (DDS). A tentative course schedule for a student’s doctoral program should be drawn up during the first semester. The courses chosen should Procedures and Policies Page 9 form a coherent plan of study, should prepare the student for a productive career in their area of interest, and should support the research work on the proposed dissertation. This schedule should be reviewed and revised at least annually. Honors Requirement The Graduate School and the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies both require that a grade of Honors be attained in a one year course or in two semester courses before enrolling for the third year. These must be graduate level courses other than those concerned exclusively with dissertation research and preparation for research, that is, they must be standard courses not research projects or independent studies. At the time of the qualifying examination, the student’s committee will determine if additional course work is necessary. Audit Policy The basic requirement for recording an official Audit is attendance at two-thirds of the class meetings, but the instructor may make additional requirements and may, in fact, require that the student do all the work of the class including exams. However, if the instructor does not require more than two-thirds attendance, auditing students should be so informed early in the semester. At the end of the semester, the instructor is asked to certify whether or not auditing students have satisfactorily completed the course. Satisfactory completion is defined as meeting the two-thirds attendance standard and the work requirements (if any) set by the instructor. Only audits certified as satisfactory are entered on the student’s transcript. Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 10 Language Requirements Forestry and Environmental Studies has no formal language requirement. Students may be required to become familiar with the content of assigned articles from the foreign literature and may, in some cases, be required to demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language on the same basis as any other area of knowledge deemed necessary to their doctoral training. Oral Proficiency Assessment for International Ph.D. Students Because a high level of proficiency in English is required for graduate students to serve as teaching fellows, students whose native language is not English will be asked to demonstrate sufficient proficiency in English. Incoming Ph.D. students may do so by: 1) by documenting completion of a BA/BS degree from an English medium higher education institution; or 2) by satisfactorily completing the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). A score of 26 or higher on the oral component of the TOEFL is considered to be satisfactory. If these two conditions are met, the Graduate School should waive the student from completing any further English language requirements. However, Yale’s English Language Program (ELP) strongly recommends that the student enroll in the Professional Communication Skills, Academic Writing, or other courses offered by the ELP, because numbers 1. and 2., above, are only minimum requirements and are only a first step towards the proficiency required for academic careers. If the two conditions are not met, and if the student’s TOEFL iBT oral score is 24, the Graduate School strongly recommends that the student take Teaching in the American Classroom in the Fall and the OPA2 assessment in December. If the student’s TOEFL iBT oral score is 23, the Graduate School recommends that the student take Speaking Fluently 2 in the Fall and Teaching in the American Classroom in the Spring and take the OPA2 assessment in April. If the student’s score is 22 or lower, the recommended courses are Speaking Fluently 1 in the Fall, Speaking Fluently 2 in the Spring, Teaching in the AmeriProcedures and Policies Page 11 can Classroom the following Fall and take the OPA2 assessment in December of the second year. The normal route to establishing proficiency is through the course sequence outlined above and OPA2. Second-year (and after) students can take the SPEAK assessment in August. A score of 50 or higher satisfies Yale’s English Oral Proficiency. (Under normal circumstances first year students are not eligible to take the SPEAK assessment.) If the student does not score 50 or higher on the SPEAK assessment in August, ELP recommends that the student take the following ELP courses based on this criteria: If the SPEAK score was 45, the student should enroll in Teaching in the American Classroom in the Fall and take the OPA2 assessment in December. If the SPEAK score was 40 or lower, then Speaking Fluently 2 in the Fall and Teaching in the American Classroom in the Spring, and the OPA2 assessment in April are recommended. For more information on the Center for Language Studies’ English Language Program, please visit their website cls.yale.edu/englishlanguage-program. Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 12 Registration All doctoral students must register each semester through their sixth year or until they submit the dissertation, whichever comes first. Continuous registration beyond the sixth year is not required for submission of the dissertation or award of the Ph.D. Students must petition for extended registration beyond the sixth year. Registration is an on-line process and directions are provided in the registration packet distributed to students at the beginning of each semester. The DDS will ‘sign off ’ on registration electronically after verifying the course load of each student. If a student requests registration in absentia or leave of absence, or extended registration, special forms must be completed and submitted to the Doctoral Program Office. These forms can be found on the Graduate School’s website: registrar.yale.edu/forms-petitions. During the semester in which the student takes the qualifying examination, S/he should register for “Qual 999, Preparing for Qualifying Exams” and need not take any classes. After successful completion of the qualifying exam, the student may register for “DISR 999, Dissertation Research”. Normally students do not take classes after advancing to candidacy, i.e. passing the qualifying exam. Registration in Absentia Ph.D. students whose program of study requires full-time dissertation research, full-time fieldwork, or full-time study at another academic institution outside the New Haven area may request to be registered in absentia. Such registration requires the recommendation of the director of graduate studies and the approval of the appropriate associate dean at the Graduate School. The forms for requesting registration in absentia may be obtained online at registrar.yale.edu/formspetitions and should be filed at least one month before the beginning of the term during which the student expects to be studying away from New Haven. Procedures and Policies Page 13 Leaves of Absence Students who wish or need to interrupt their study temporarily may request a leave of absence. There are three types of leave—personal, medical, and parental. For the policy regarding leaves of absence, please see the Graduate School’s Programs and Policies booklet which can be found at their website: gsas.yale.edu/academics/ programs-policies . Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 14 Selection of Major Prof. & Formation of Committee Each new doctoral student will have selected and contacted a faculty advisor before entering the program. If this arrangement is not satisfactory, the student must contact the DDS and appropriate alternative arrangements will be pursued in consultation with the concerned parties, such changes are expected to be unusual. The student should confer with a faculty member or members s/he considers most appropriate and decide which one s/he would prefer to have designated as major professor. S/he should then consult with the DDS, who will confer with the faculty member. If for some reason it is not possible or appropriate for the student’s choice to be designated as major professor, an appropriate selection will be made in consultation with between the student, the DDS and the potential major professor. Designation of a student’s major professor (who is also Chair of his or her doctoral committee) should be finalized early in the first year, preferably at the beginning of the first semester. In no case should this process extend beyond the first year. In cases where the designation of a major professor has not been finalized, the Director of Doctoral Studies will serve as a temporary advisor. The doctoral committee will normally consist of a minimum of three members from the Yale community – the chair and two other advisors. Committee chairs must be ladder faculty. The most important consideration in the selection of the committee is that all members be willing and qualified to guide and support the academic activities of the student. The members of the committee are selected by the major professor in consultation with the student. All external as well as internal committee members must agree to attend at least the qualifying examination and thesis defense. The selection of the full committee should be made early in the first year of residence so that the members can be involved in planning a suitable program of study for the student. Procedures and Policies Page 15 Qualifying Examination The qualifying examination consists of three parts: (1) a written thesis proposal with a one-page abstract, (2) a written examination (2 options), and (3) an oral defense of the thesis proposal and the written examination questions. The student will be advised as to the nature and scope of the qualifying examination prior to or at the start of the semester in which it is to be administered. Normally, the examination will be taken in the second year of residence, and no later than the end of the third year of study. Without written permission from the DDS, no student will be permitted to register for a fourth year of study if the Qualifying Exam has not been successfully completed. Students may register for “Qual 999, Preparing for Qualifying Exam”, and need not register for any classes, in the semester in which they take the qualifying exam. Qualifying exams and prospectuses from previous years are kept in the doctoral program office, and students may refer to these as examples before taking their own exam. The student should inform Elisabeth Barsa once the schedule for the qualifying exam has been determined. The Doctoral Program Office will send out an announcement and invitation to faculty, not less than one week before the oral portion of the exam will take place. The written portion of the examination should be scheduled during the academic year and before the oral examination. The student will submit copies of the qualifying exam questions and answers and dissertation proposal to each member of his or her committee. In addition, the student must submit one electronic copy to the Doctoral Program Office for circulation to the faculty at large. Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 16 Thesis Proposal The thesis proposal is a detailed work plan for the student’s dissertation including: a statement of the central research question, a literature review demonstrating the importance and uniqueness of the question, a statement of objectives, hypotheses to be tested, a description of research approach and methods to be used, a schedule, a proposed budget, preliminary results (if any), and results anticipated. It must include an abstract of one page or less summarizing the elements above. The student must prepare the thesis proposal during the semester in which the qualifying examination takes place. The thesis proposal is part of the written qualifying examination. It is submitted to the committee for review at the same time as the other written questions (see written examination section below) and must be defended by the student during the oral defense. The student must also prepare, and submit to the Doctoral Program Office, a one-page thesis abstract before being admitted to candidacy. Students are expected to begin developing the ideas that will form the basis for their thesis proposals as soon as they enter the doctoral program. Procedures and Policies Page 17 Written Qualifying Examination Two forms are available for the written qualifying examination: Option 1 requires extensive written analyses on 2 topics; Option 2 requires shorter written analyses on between 2 and 16 questions. Each is designed to evaluate the student’s background preparation and knowledge appropriate to the preparation of a doctoral dissertation. Under both options, the student will be advised as to the nature and scope of the examination at least one semester prior to the examination. Well ahead of the written examination, the student’s dissertation committee will be formed. Committee members will participate, along with the advisor, in the formulation and administration of the written examination. Under Option 1, the written examination involves the preparation of analyses of 2 topics assigned by the student’s committee. The analyses will be prepared with access to the literature. The first will ordinarily require a statement of judgment on some controversial issue in the student’s field of interest. The two should not demand closely related answers and normally are chosen to encourage the student to develop a broader understanding of the research question context. Students are allowed two weeks to complete the written examination under Option 1. Under Option 2, the written examination consists of between 2 and 16 questions in areas relevant to the student’s academic interests. The examination is administered in two four-hour periods. Each four hour period will take place on a separate day. Regardless of when the portions of the written examination are administered under Option 2, all portions of the written examination as well as the oral examination and the thesis proposal are expected to be completed by the end of the second year in the program under normal circumstances, and no later than the end of the third year otherwise. Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 18 Oral Examination The scheduling and conduct of the oral examination is the responsibility of the student’s advisor. The entire committee, along with the advisor, must participate in the oral examination. It should be held no sooner than ten days after the student has submitted responses to the topics or questions. The DDS and Doctoral Program staff should be informed of the time and place of the examination as early as possible so that a notice can be sent to the faculty and committee members. The oral examination will be scheduled during the academic year, except in unusual circumstances (permission must be requested of the DDS for an examination outside of the normal academic year). The advisor will chair the oral examination which is open to all members of the FES faculty. Attending faculty are also welcome to ask questions. The student should be prepared to make a brief presentation of their thesis proposal (approximately 30-45 minutes) and then respond to questions from the advisor, committee, and attending faculty. A successful oral defense of the written examination questions and thesis proposal should inspire confidence that the dissertation topic is viable and that the student is prepared to make good on the proposed research plan. Under both written examination options, the general background of the student in his or her area of interest, issues arising from written examination responses, as well as knowledge of the specific dissertation area may be explored during the oral examination. The responses to both written and oral examination questions are evaluated by the advisor and the committee members. The examination as a whole (written examination, oral examination, thesis proposal) is assigned a Pass, Conditional Pass, or Fail. A grade of Conditional Pass may be accompanied by conditions that must be met before a student will be allowed to advance to candidacy. As one example, the student may, after a period of study, be reexamined on portions of the examination in which he/she proved deficient. Repeated failure in any area may be grounds for asking for the withdrawal of the Procedures and Policies Page 19 student based on the assessment of the advisor, the committee, and the DDS. In some cases, the advisor and committee may require the student to take additional coursework in order to rectify identified knowledge gaps. Following the completion of coursework, the advisor and committee may, if they choose, ask the student to participate in a follow up oral examination or to prepare a written document addressing the issue identified during the original examinations. Immediately following the oral examination, the advisor should communicate the outcome to the DDS and to Doctoral Program Staff. If conditions are attached to a grade of Conditional Pass, they should be delineated in writing along with a timeline for their resolution. This document should be shared with the student as well. Note that students must erase any such deficiencies before the end of their 3rd year in the program. All students must also prepare, and submit to the Doctoral Program Office, a one-page thesis abstract before being admitted to candidacy. Admission to Candidacy After the student has (1) passed the written and oral examinations, (2) submitted a one-page prospectus covering the nature, scope, and method of the dissertation problem to the DDS, and (3) received honors grades in at least two courses, he or she is advanced to candidacy. The student is then certified as having met all requirements for the Ph.D. except for the preparation, submission and defense of an acceptable dissertation. After a student passes the comprehensive examination and is accepted into candidacy for the Ph.D., he or she may still elect or be required to take additional coursework. However, it is expected that, following the successful completion of the comprehensive examination, doctoral students will devote most of their time to research and thesis preparation and should register for “DISR 999, Dissertation Research” (in residence or in absentia) each semester. Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 20 Dissertation Progress Report Ph.D. students who have been admitted to candidacy (i.e., completed the honors requirement and passed the qualifying exam) must continue to demonstrate satisfactory progress toward the degree in the annual Dissertation Progress Report. The report must be filled out and submitted electronically, registrar.yale.edu/dpr. Students who fail to submit the report will be put on registration hold for the following semester. The Dissertation Progress Report is due May 1. Master of Philosophy Degree The M.Phil. degree is awarded to students after they’ve advanced to candidacy. Procedures and Policies Page 21 Dissertation The dissertation should demonstrate that the student has both conceptual and technical mastery of the field presented, is capable of doing independent, original, and scholarly work, and is able to develop significant contributions to our knowledge of environmental science and management. A guidance manual for thesis preparation, “Guide to Formatting the Doctoral Dissertation”, can be found online: gsas.yale.edu/academics/dissertations/submission-process. Candidates may present themselves for the oral defense of the dissertation at such time and place as agreed to by the student’s committee and the Director of Doctoral Studies. Digital Dissertations are available from the Yale Library’s subscription to the Proquest Digital Dissertations Database: www.library.yale.edu, then click “Find Databases by Title”, then “D”, then scroll down for “Dissertations & Thesis”. Dissertation research will be directed by the student’s major professor and coordinated with the members of the student’s committee. Dissertation Defense The oral defense of the dissertation is a necessary part of the discipline of research. It provides the candidate with an opportunity to explain and defend his/her work publicly, just as s/he must do as an independent investigator. It also provides the student with a sympathetic group of examiners who can and should offer suggestions on how the study could have been improved and how the final draft can be improved. The DDS will schedule the oral defense in consultation with the student’s major professor and will notify the faculty as to the time and place of the defense. The major advisor will chair the defense. The candidate will first present a 30-45 minute summary of the thesis. This part of the defense is open to the public. The student should present the thesis work as he or she would a scientific paper at a national academic conference. The questioning of the candidate on his/her Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 22 dissertation at the oral defense will be primarily the responsibility of the candidate’s committee, but any interested faculty member may attend and take part in the examination. This part of the defense is only open to faculty members. Before the defense, copies of the dissertation should be provided to the F&ES Doctoral Program Office and committee members: • Prepare and present complete, softbound copies of the dissertation to the committee members. Additionally, submit one electronic copy to the Doctoral Program Office (elisabeth.barsa@yale.edu). This should be done at least 10 business days before the scheduled defense. The members of the committee, with the advice of faculty present, then will vote on whether or not to accept the dissertation (perhaps with minor but not substantive revisions) as fulfilling the departmental requirements for the dissertation. After the defense, the candidate formally submits the dissertation to the Graduate School , instructions below. Dissertation Readers The Yale Graduate School and F&ES require that each dissertation be read and evaluated by at least three “readers”, at least two of whom have tenure or tenure track positions at Yale. Additionally, F&ES requires that one of the “readers” must be from outside of the student’s advisory committee. The major advisor of the dissertation is not eligible to be a reader for that dissertation. After the student formally submits the dissertation, the Graduate School will send the dissertation and evaluation forms to the approved readers. The students Advisor, in consultation with the committee and sometimes with the student, chooses the readers, and sends their names and contact information to the F&ES Doctoral Program office. It is the responsibility of the advisor to ensure the readers have agreed to evaluate the dissertation, and in the time frame required (one month), beforehand. Procedures and Policies Page 23 Dissertation Submission The dissertation submission process is explained in detail on the Graduate School’s website, gsas.yale.edu/academics/dissertations/ submission-process. In sum, once the adviser and committee have approved a dissertation for submission and the director of graduate studies has been notified, the student submits one unbound copy of the dissertation, softbound copies that will be distributed to each reader, a completed set of required forms (available at gsas.yale.edu/academics/dissertations/ submission-process), and any requisite fees to the Graduate School. The department must submit to the Graduate School a fully completed “Notification of Readers” form that has been approved by the director of graduate studies. Note: It is a courtesy for the student to provide his or her major professor with a hardbound copy of the dissertation and also such other faculty members who have been very helpful to the student. The DDS reviews the Reader Reports and makes a recommendation to the Faculty of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies to approve/deny the degree. If the School decides that the dissertation is acceptable, the faculty recommends the award of the degree to the Graduate School. Dissertations must be submitted to the Graduate School by the respective deadlines in the academic calendar to be considered for December or May degrees. No exceptions are made to these deadlines, which have been established to allow sufficient time for departments to receive evaluations from readers and recommend students to the degree committees. Yale Page 24 F&ES Doctoral Program Schedule for Defense, Submission, and Graduation Failure to meet the various deadlines will result in a six month delay in graduation. It should be noted that dissertations submitted during the summer months will not receive official faculty consideration or action until after the opening date of the University in the fall.

Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 32 Financial Support Most doctoral students receive a School fellowship that covers the cost of their tuition ($42,100 in 2018-2019), health care, and provides a twelve-month stipend ($31,000 in 2018-2019). Unless the student’s financial need changes significantly, progress toward the Doctoral degree is unsatisfactory, or teaching responsibilities are not met, the student may expect to receive a similar level of support for the first five years of their doctoral studies. Teaching and Funding Policy Teaching experiences are regarded as integral parts of the graduate training program in F&ES. All students are required to serve as teaching fellows (minimum of 10 hours per week) for four semesters prior to the end of their fifth year of study. With the permission of the Director of Doctoral Studies (DDS), the total teaching requirement may be reduced for students who are awarded fellowships supported by outside funding. The nature of your teaching assignments will be determined in cooperation with your major advisor and the DDS. Regardless of outside funding, all doctoral students must serve as teaching fellows for a minimum of two semesters. 1. Students can only serve in a primary role as grader for a maximum of two semesters, i.e., to provide value to the teaching experience, they must run a discussion section or laboratory in which they take responsibility for direct teaching for at least two semesters. 2. Following the policy of the Graduate School, students typically will not teach during their first year in the Program. Students who feel that their circumstances are unusual can petition the DDS for permission to teach during the first year. Students may teach in courses outside of the School to meet their teaching obligations. Graduate School policy requires that this must be approved by the DDS in the School in consultation with the Graduate School. Procedures and Policies Page 33 The Graduate School requires all graduate students teaching for the first time at Yale to attend a “Teaching at Yale Day” workshop offered by the Yale Center for Teaching and Learning. Teaching at Yale Day will be offered on August 27, 2018 and January 11, 2019. For more information see the Yale Center for Teaching and Learning website: ctl.yale.edu/teaching. External Fellowships and Combined Award Policy To benefit both their current work and their future career prospects, students are strongly encouraged to seek funding from external agencies through grants. These awards, sponsored by both public and private agencies, confer distinction on a student who wins an award in a national competition. Students receiving external awards have two options. They may either (1) hold the outside awards in conjunction with University stipends (including research and teaching fellowships) up to the total of the standard department/program stipend plus $4,000 or (2) defer financial support awarded in their admission offer for up to one year. Students must report to their Graduate School Deans (Assoc. Dean Richard Sleight or Asst. Dean Robert HarperMangels) and to Elisabeth Barsa any scholarship/fellowship received from an outside agency or organization. For more information on the Combined Award Policy, see the Graduate School’s Programs and Policies booklet, gsas.yale.edu/funding-aid/fellowships/externalcombined-awards. Further incentives in addition to the Graduate School’s Combined Award Policy: * Any student who brings in one full year of stipend recovery will be relieved of one semester of TA service. The same applies for a second or third year of stipend recovery. All students, irrespective of outside funding, need to teach for two semesters. Yale F&ES Doctoral Program Page 34 Travel Funds for Doctoral Students The F&ES Doctoral Program provides funds to support travel to conferences for doctoral students. Funds are available only for those presenting posters or papers. Proposals should be submitted to Elisabeth Barsa in the Doctoral Program Office. Proposals should include an abstract of the paper or poster, a copy of the invitation and conference agenda, a budget, and a statement declaring whether doctoral travel funds have been received in the past. Awards will not exceed $500 per student. Proposals should not exceed two pages in length and should be submitted BEFORE attendance at the conference. Students must save their receipts so that they can be reimbursed after the conference. Students will not be awarded travel grants of up to $500, more than once per fiscal year. The last day of the fiscal year is June 30th, July 1st is the beginning of the fiscal year. Procedures and Policies Page 35 Grants, Contracts, Sponsored Research, and Cooperative Agreements Most F&ES doctoral students support their research, in part, through outside funds. Students have been extraordinarily resourceful in locating funding sources and enjoy a high rate of success in competitive funding schemes. Your advisor and fellow students are good sources of information about potential funding as is Elisabeth Barsa, the Doctoral Program Coordinator. Once you have developed an idea of goals and funding needs associated with the research project you wish to have supported, one of your first stops should be a visit with members of the F&ES staff whose responsibility includes supporting students in their efforts to secure funding. Grants come in a variety of flavors with very different application and evaluation processes. Gai Doran, Director of Research, is responsible for supporting applications to government sponsored funding sources (e.g., NSF, EPA, USDA, Fulbright). If you are interested in seeking funding from a private foundation, you should contact Lisa Bassani, Assistant Director of Development & Alumni Services. Both Gai and Lisa have a good understanding of the funding landscapes for their respective areas. Speaking to them earlier in your program can help smooth the transition from developing your thesis ideas to getting down to work. As a rule of thumb, you will want to apply for funding six months to a year before you will need the support. Yale requires that any person seeking funding (including faculty) must be authorized in advance. In practice, this means all proposals must be reviewed by the University’s grants administrative staff prior to being sent to any organization. Once a proposal is developed it is required that you provide the original grant proposal to the F&ES Business Office to begin the discussion regarding deadlines and requisite authorizations. The F&ES Dean and Yale’s grants and contracts staff members must sign/approve the proposal before it is sent to a funding agency. It is recommended that all proposals be submitted to the Business Office early so as to permit the Dean and then the University grants staff time to read, understand, question and improve the proposal; two or three weeks in advance is highly recommended!

Purpose of the BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook This handbook has been prepared as an overview for the convenience of current and prospective students in the various Doctor of Education programs in Bagwell College of Education (BCOE) at Kennesaw State University (KSU). This handbook is not intended to be a substitute for carefully reading the KSU Graduate Catalog and other documents prepared by the KSU Graduate College. Some of the content in this handbook is restated information from the current catalog. The official document for BCOE’s Ed.D. degree programs is the Kennesaw State University Graduate Catalog of the academic year in which the student is admitted. Each doctoral student is responsible for knowing about and keeping up with specific degree requirements and expectations as outlined in his or her academic year catalog. II. Purpose of the BCOE Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) Programs The Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) degree programs offered by the Bagwell College of Education (BCOE) prepare professional educators who are practitioner scholars, content knowledge specialists, and instructional leaders who innovate, critically reflect, and effectively teach and lead within diverse P-20 educational settings. These doctoral programs prepare graduates to investigate theoretical constructs related to teaching, leading, and learning through applied research that advances knowledge and informs educational practice and/or policy. Our doctoral programs are designed for experienced educators and school leaders. Our students are typically full-time professionals who address real-world problems in P-12 schools. Some programs are delivered fully online (Instructional Technology, Teacher Leadership) while others combine face-to-face, hybrid, and online learning experiences. All programs offer learning experiences that maximize collaboration with professional colleagues and peers. We currently offer the following Ed.D. degree programs: Ed.D. in Early Childhood Education Ed.D. in Educational Leadership Ed.D. in Instructional Technology: Initial or Advanced Track Ed.D. in Middle Grades Education: Language Arts Ed.D. in Middle Grades Education: Mathematics Ed.D. in Middle Grades Education: Social Studies Ed.D. in Secondary Education: Chemistry Ed.D. in Secondary Education: English Ed.D. in Secondary Education: History Ed.D. in Secondary Education: Mathematics Ed.D. in Special Education: General Curriculum Ed.D. in Teacher Leadership KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 3 III. Admission and Entrance Requirements Each BCOE doctoral program specifies admission requirements. The admissions process for the doctoral degree consists of multiple levels of review and is a highly competitive process. The final evaluation of applicant files is conducted by the doctoral admissions committee within each program. Faculty within each committee systematically evaluate application files. The committee’s recommendation for an individual’s admission into the Ed.D. program is based upon the committee’s collective professional judgment of the overall merit of each applicant. The determination of the merits of each applicant’s admission file focuses on a number of key variables that are vitally important to a candidate’s ability to complete a doctoral degree successfully. Those factors include related undergraduate and graduate degrees (master’s degree required); academic performance and achievement; professional teaching and administrative certifications; professional employment in P-12 schools; verbal and writing skills; quantitative and problem solving skills; evidence of teaching effectiveness; evidence of educational and/or teacher leadership; sound educational philosophies and professional ethics; and other related contributions and achievements of note. Formal admission to the doctoral program occurs only when the student receives a signed letter of acceptance to the doctoral program from the Office of Education Student Services in the Bagwell College of Education. For information on specific admissions requirements for each BCOE doctoral program, see the Graduate Catalog or the program’s website. For more information on how to apply, see http://graduate.kennesaw.edu/admissions/. For more information concerning the admissions process, contact the Graduate Admissions Coordinator, BCOE Office of Student Services at 470-KSU-6043 or graded@kennesaw.edu. IV. Transfer of Credit and Time Limits (Age of Credit) Graduate work completed at other regionally accredited institutions must be evaluated and approved by the doctoral program coordinator and graduate faculty of the respective program in order to satisfy degree requirements at KSU. Such transfer credit cannot exceed 25% of the total semester hours required for the degree and cannot reduce residency requirements. No grade below B may be accepted. Transfer grades are not used in calculating semester, summer term, or cumulative grade point averages. Individual degree programs may have additional specific requirements or limitations for transfer credit. Refer to the program descriptions in the Graduate Catalog or contact the doctoral program coordinator for additional information on transfer credit. KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 4 Students who wish to have credits transferred from another university to their doctoral program in the Bagwell College of Education must begin the application for transfer with their program coordinator, submit a Request for Transfer of Credit form along with an official transcript and catalog description of the course(s), and comply with Graduate Catalog policies. Unless otherwise stated in the specific program description in the Graduate Catalog, all requirements for a doctoral degree must be completed within ten years, beginning with the first registration in graduate-level classes following admission to the degree program. The Graduate College may grant an extension of time for conditions beyond the student's control. V. Minimum Completion Requirements The Doctor of Education degree (Ed.D.) in the Bagwell College of Education is awarded to students who complete the following: • Maintain an overall grade point average of 3.0 or higher for all coursework taken in the program. • Successfully complete all credit hours (the amount is program specific) as indicated in the program of study. • Near the completion of course work, pass a written comprehensive examination; • Successfully defend the dissertation proposal. • Complete and successfully defend the dissertation. • Using Owl Express, file the Petition to Graduate form (following deadlines published by the Registrar) and pay the graduation fee. • Submit all required doctoral forms and signature pages as directed by your program coordinator and dissertation chair. • Electronically submit the final copy of the approved dissertation to Digital Commons. In addition, the responsibilities of the doctoral student include the following: • Follow the guidelines for doctoral students and dissertations in this handbook and as directed by program coordinators and dissertation chairs. • Establish a reasonable timeline for completion of all degree requirements (see dissertation timeline in this handbook and determine dates as appropriate). • Work closely with the program coordinator, advisor (if one is assigned), dissertation chair and committee. In some programs, students will be assigned a faculty advisor upon admission. At some point in all programs, students will invite a graduate faculty member in the Bagwell College of Education or in his/her content discipline to serve as dissertation chair. The committee members are selected collaboratively and agreed upon with input from the KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 5 chair. The dissertation chair will work together with the committee to provide advice on matters related to the program of study, comprehensive examination, proposal, and dissertation. • Prepare for any written or oral examinations by being thoroughly familiar with the material that is central to the topics being discussed. This preparation will greatly increase the chances of successfully passing these examinations. • Monitor progress closely. Program coordinators and dissertation chairs assist in this, but ultimately it is the student's responsibility to make sure forms are filed when necessary and examinations are appropriately scheduled. • Attend specific programs and/or Bagwell College of Education workshops and seminars for the duration of the time you are enrolled in the program. • If possible, attend and/or present with faculty at local, regional, national, or international conferences. • Adhere to KSU’s standards of academic honesty and exhibit professional dispositions at all times. Student should understand KSU’s process for addressing academic misconduct and plagiarism. For more information, see http://scai.kennesaw.edu/faculty/academic-misconduct.php. VI. Academic Requirements Full-time Load. Full-time enrollment for graduate students is 9 semester hours. Typical load for BCOE doctoral students is 6 semester hours. Graduate students in good standing may enroll for 12 semester hours in any semester. To enroll for more than 12 semester hours, students must obtain approval from their graduate program coordinator. Residency Requirement. To receive a graduate degree from Kennesaw State University, students must complete at least 75% of the total semester hours required for the degree within their graduate program at KSU. All of these hours must be completed after the student has been admitted to the degree program. The Residency Requirement should be considered prior to completing the Transfer of Credit Request form. Continuous Enrollment Policy. Students enrolled in a Graduate degree program must register for at least one course in at least one semester per academic year in order for the original program requirements for their degree to remain unchanged unless a Leave of Absence has been approved. If dissertation, thesis, capstone or project courses comprise 50% or more of a student's credit hours in any semester, they must be continuously enrolled every semester thereafter until satisfying the requirements of the student's program. Summer registration is not required unless the student intends to graduate in summer semester. Students who have completed all coursework and are planning to submit a dissertation in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a doctoral degree should register for dissertation hours consistent with a realistic appraisal of the amount of remaining dissertation work and required faculty involvement. Students are KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 6 not eligible to receive thesis, dissertation or project guidance nor use campus resources during any term for which they are not registered. If a student has completed all degree requirements and will no longer require any of the campus resources or faculty time, the student may request an enrollment waiver. Graduate students must be registered for at least one semester hour in the semester, or proceeding semester, they plan to graduate. Leave of Absence. A leave of absence provides a mechanism for students experiencing unusual circumstances to be exempt temporarily from the continuous enrollment policy. A leave of absence requires approval of the Graduate Program Coordinator and the Graduate College. A leave of absence will be granted only for good cause such as serious medical and health-related issues; major financial and employment issues; pregnancy, childbirth, child care, elder care, and other significant family issues; and other major personal circumstances that interfere with the ability to undertake graduate study. • An approved leave of absence stands in lieu of registering for the minimum of one (1) credit for each semester for which the leave of absence is granted. During a leave of absence, students may not use KSU facilities, resources, or services designed or intended only for enrolled students; receive a graduate assistantship, fellowship, or financial aid from the University; or take any KSU courses related to their program of study. Time on leave counts toward any University, Graduate College, or program time limits pertaining to the degree being sought. The Graduate College, at its discretion, may grant an extension of the time to degree completion. • Application. Students may apply for a leave of absence for good cause such as serious medical and health-related issues, major financial and employment issues; pregnancy, childbirth, childcare, elder care, and other significant family issues; and other major personal circumstances that interfere with the ability to undertake graduate study. An approved leave of absence stands in lieu of registering for the minimum of one (1) credit for each semester for which the leave of absence is granted. • External Limitations. An approved leave of absence does not exempt students from the enrollment requirements of other programs, offices and agencies such as the Veterans Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and federal financial aid programs. Please note that eligibility for certain types of financial aid (including graduate assistantships) may require enrollment for credits beyond those required by the Continuous Enrollment Policy. It is the student's responsibility to notify other appropriate agencies as necessary, as well as ensuring the leave does not adversely affect the student. • Deadlines. It is the student's responsibility to apply for a leave of absence in a timely fashion. A student may apply for a leave of absence before or during any semester in which they are not registered for courses. Application for a leave of absence must be received by the Graduate College on or before the last day of KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 7 classes for the semester for which it is requested. A leave of absence will not be granted retroactively after the end of the semester. • Limits. A student may request a leave of absence for one semester, two consecutive semesters, or three consecutive semesters (summer semester included). There is a 12-month limit for any one request of leave of absence. A student may submit multiple requests for a leave of absence subject to a 3- semester limit while enrolled in a specific graduate program. VII. Program of Study and Registration Information Program of Study. The Program of Study for the Ed.D. is an advising guide showing how students should proceed with coursework. Each program coordinator and faculty advisor will outline the courses students need to complete for graduation and when these courses should be completed on a semester-by-semester basis. Ed.D. students are encouraged to communicate regularly with program coordinator and faculty advisors each semester to ensure they are taking the correct classes and are on track for graduation. Once a Program of Study is created and/or updated (i.e., course substitutions, independent studies, etc.), the Program of Study form should be submitted. Students should keep copies of all official documents in their own records. Student Guide to Degree Progression (DegreeWorks). DegreeWorks is a web-based advising tool that provides real-time advice on degree completion. This system is designed to aid and facilitate academic advising. It is not intended to replace face-to- face advising sessions. DegreeWorks is available to all degree seeking graduate students who have a catalog year equal to Fall 2011 or later. Students with a catalog year prior to those listed above should continue to meet with their academic advisor concerning degree progression. Students can access DegreeWorks through Owl Express. Possible Embedded Ed.S. Degree. In some BCOE Ed.D. programs, students have the opportunity to receive an Ed.S. (Specialist in Education degree) after the completion of 30-33 credit hours. Students are encouraged to review each program’s website for specific information regarding this embedded degree opportunity. Registration. All registration at Kennesaw State University is conducted over the web through Owl Express. New graduate students, as well as continuing students, may register during the registration period in the preceding term or during the final registration period. Any course adjustments (dropping and adding classes) should be completed during this final registration period. Access to registration will be granted by time tickets in Banner/Owl Express based on a student's number of overall earned hours. The University may grant earlier access to registration to certain students who have been approved by the University. Specific dates can be found on the academic calendar located on the KSU Registrar webpage: http://registrar.kennesaw.edu/. KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 8 Verification of Class Schedule. Students should verify their class schedule for each semester enrolled. No course additions/deletions are permitted after the Drop/Add period has ended. It is the student's responsibility to verify their class schedule (including credit hours) on Owl Express for accuracy. Withdrawal from Courses. Students may withdraw from one or more courses up to one week prior to the last day of class. To completely or partially withdraw from classes at KSU, a student must withdraw online at www.kennesaw.edu, under Owl Express, Registration and Student Records. Students who officially withdraw from courses before mid-semester will receive a "W" in those courses and receive no credit. They will not, however, suffer any academic penalty. Students who officially withdraw after mid- semester (one week prior to the last day of class) will receive a "WF," which will be counted as an "F" in the calculation of their grade point average. Exact withdrawal dates will be published in the official academic calendar and are subject to approval by the Board of Regents. The only exceptions to these withdrawal regulations will be for instances involving unusual circumstances that are fully documented. Students will receive refunds only when they withdraw from all their classes and only by the schedule outlined in the University System refund policy. VIII.

Academic Policies Grade Expectations for Satisfactory Graduate Level Performance. Each course syllabus sets the standard for academic grades. Class attendance is required, as specified by each course instructor. Graduate students are expected to earn grades of at least "B" in most of their course work for their degree. For graduation, a graduate student must have earned a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 in all graduate course work at Kennesaw State University and a grade of "C" or better in each course presented to meet degree requirements. Academic Probation. Whenever a graduate student's institutional graduate grade point average drops below 3.0, that student will be placed on probation and be advised of the significance and potential consequences of this action. While on probation, the student will not be permitted to take comprehensive exams or obtain a graduate degree. Academic probation may also affect a student's financial aid status or eligibility to hold a graduate assistantship. Students on probation are only allowed to register for courses during final registration. Graduate students can have their probationary status removed by raising their institutional grade-point average to at least 3.0. Individual graduate programs may have additional expectations and/or grading policies. Please see specific graduate program sections of the Graduate Catalog for additional information on graduate expectations. Dismissal. Graduate students will be dismissed from further graduate study under any of the following conditions: (1) while on probation, the term GPA is less than 3.0 or (2) not achieving an institutional graduate GPA of 3.0 after two semesters KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 10 Reinstatement. As a general practice, students who wish to request reinstatement after their dismissal must sit out at least one semester or summer term. The student must complete the "Request for Reinstatement" form and submit it to the Office of Graduate Admissions. The form will be routed to the appropriate graduate program personnel for review. The program will then forward their recommendation to the Dean of the Graduate College. The Dean of the Graduate College will then notify the appropriate graduate program coordinator, the Office of the Registrar, and the student of his/her decision. Graduate students who are granted a reinstatement must agree to a remediation plan. Any deviation from the remediation plan will result in permanent dismissal. Individual graduate programs may have additional expectations and/or grading policies. Please see specific graduate program sections of the Graduate Catalog for additional information on graduate expectations. Incomplete Grades. The grade of "I" denotes an incomplete grade for the course, and will be awarded only when the student has done satisfactory work up to the last two weeks of the semester, but for nonacademic reasons beyond his/her control is unable to meet the full requirements of the course. The grade of "I" must be removed by the end of the next semester or term. The grade of "I" will not be included in the calculation of the student's scholastic average at the end of the semester in which the grade of "I" is received. Upon completion of the outstanding requirements within the specified time limit, a final grade of "A," "B," "C," "D," or "F" will be assigned in the course on the basis of the student's total performance, and the grade will then be included in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average. If the outstanding work is not completed by the end of the following semester or term, the "I" will be changed to an "F" and calculated into the student's cumulative grade point average. An "I" cannot be removed by reenrolling in the course. IP (In Progress) Grade. In most graduate courses, the grades "A," "B," "C," "D," "F," "I" (Incomplete), "W" (Withdrawal), and "WF" (Withdrawal with an "F") are awarded. In some graduate courses, the notation "IP" (In Progress) is used, particularly thesis, dissertation, and capstone/project courses intended to extend beyond one semester. A student will enroll for a specified number of hours in each consecutive semester in which work is still in progress. While the work is in progress, the instructor will report a grade of "IP" for these credit hours at the end of each term. Thesis, dissertation, and project course credit hours taken during the semester that the work is completed will be awarded a grade of "S" (satisfactory) or "U" (unsatisfactory). Grades of "IP," "S," or "U" will not be computed in the student's grade-point average. Grade Appeals. Kennesaw State University is committed to treating students fairly in the grading process. Students may appeal a final grade that they receive in a course, but interim grades or grades on specific assignments cannot be appealed. Any such appeal must be based on an allegation that the faculty member has violated his/her stated grading policy in the course syllabus or that the grade was a result of discrimination or KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 11 retaliation. The student has the burden of proving these allegations. All formal appeals under these procedures will be based only on the written record. • Informal: Students are encouraged to discuss concerns and disputes over final course grades with the faculty member, prior to filing a formal grade appeal, in an effort to understand the basis of his/her grade. Faculty members are encouraged to be available to students for such discussion regarding grades so that if possible, grade disputes can be resolved informally. • Formal: In situations where such informal resolution does not occur or is not successful, the student may appeal the final course grade to the Department Chair. The appeal must be in writing and describe the precise basis for the appeal. Any pertinent information must be submitted with the appeal in order to be considered in this or subsequent appeals. The appeal must be submitted within 20 business days after the first day of classes of the next academic term (fall, spring, summer [or any other term]) after the academic term in which the final grade was awarded to the student. The Chair will invite the faculty member whose grade is appealed to provide a written response to the student's appeal statement. The Department Chair (or the Chair's designee) will review the allegations and conduct any additional fact finding as needed and will provide a decision in writing to the student, within 20 business days of the receipt of the complaint in the Department if there is no allegation of discrimination or retaliation that impacted the grade. The Chair's written decision will specifically address the relevant issues raised by the student. If the student alleges that the grade was a result of discrimination or retaliation, the following procedures will be followed. The Chair will consult with the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) if there is an allegation that discrimination or retaliation based on status in a protected class has an impact on the grade. Please see http://equity.kennesaw.edu/titleix/non-discrimination.php for the University's Non-Discrimination Statement. The Executive Director of Institutional Equity or designee will review the information provided by the Chair to determine jurisdiction, routing, and whether an investigation is warranted; if so, the OIE will conduct an investigation. The general timeframe for the investigation is 60 business days, absent any special circumstances. The OIE will issue an investigation report to the Chair. The Chair will use the OIE investigation report to make the grade appeal decision and communicate the decision to the student within twenty (20) business days after receipt of the OIE investigation report. The Chair's written decision will specifically address the relevant issues raised by the student. • The student may appeal the Department Chair's decision within 20 business days of being notified of the Chair's decision. Such appeal will be made, in writing, to the Dean of the College in which the Department is located. At the Dean's discretion, the Dean can appoint an advisory panel, consisting of two (2) faculty KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 12 members from outside the department where the grade was awarded and one (1) student to review the written documentation and make a recommendation to the Dean. The advisory panel may invite the student and the faculty member who awarded the grade to meet with the panel to share each party's position on the grade dispute. The panel will provide a written recommendation to the Dean within ten (10) business days of the receipt of the appeal. The Dean will issue a decision to the student, in writing, within ten (10) business days of the receipt of the report from the advisory panel or within twenty (20) business days of the receipt of the written complaint from the student if no panel was appointed. • The student may appeal the Dean's decision to the Provost, in writing, within twenty (20) business days of being notified of the Dean's decision. [However, if it is a graduate course, the student will direct this written appeal to the Graduate Dean, and the Graduate Dean will issue a decision to the student, in writing, within twenty (20) business days of receiving the appeal. Within twenty (20) days of that decision, the student may then appeal to the Provost as is described in this section]. The Provost will issue a decision to the student in writing within twenty (20) business days of receiving the appeal. • The Provost's decision is final, and decisions regarding grades may not be appealed to the Board of Regents (BOR Policy 4.7.1) Nothing in this grade appeals process prohibits the parties from settling this matter at any stage. However, any attempt to settle the matter through mediation does not affect time deadlines for this grade appeals process. X. Dissertation Chair and Committee Selection, Comprehensive Examination, Dissertation Proposal, and Dissertation In some programs, students will be assigned a faculty advisor upon admission. At some point in all programs, students will invite a graduate faculty member in the Bagwell College of Education or in his/her content discipline to serve as dissertation chair. Students should request a chair based on the faculty member’s expertise in the area of research and based on an appropriate level of trust, collaboration, and mentorship between the faculty member and the student. Process for Forming the Dissertation Committee. Prior to meeting with faculty, the doctoral student should: 1. Write a concept paper of the tentative dissertation topic to provide (a) to the potential chair and, once committee members are collaboratively chosen and agreed upon with input from the chair, (b) the committee members. KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 13 2. The concept paper serves as an early communication and brainstorming tool between the candidate, dissertation chair and committee about the proposed research. The student should understand that the dissertation will likely be quite different from what is explored initially in the concept paper as the chair and committee members work with the student to formalize the research into the final dissertation proposal. Typically, the concept paper presents an early overview of the proposed research problem, its context, and initial thoughts on research design and methodology. At minimum, the paper should include the following: • Purpose and significance of the research; • Conceptual framework and brief literature review; • Overview of major studies, scholars, theorists and related literature that informs the research questions and design; • Problem statement or research questions; • Research design, including initial thoughts on data collection methods, participants, instruments, and data analysis procedures; • References or works cited. The process of dissertation committee formation begins when the student contacts the potential dissertation chair, forwarding the Concept Paper for consideration. Next, the student meets with the potential chair to the discuss research topic and his/her service as chair. At this point, the faculty member may ask for more information or may agree or not agree to serve. After consulting and reaching agreement with the dissertation chair, the student will then invite two additional faculty members to sit on the dissertation committee. The student should forward the Concept Paper to each faculty member for his/her consideration prior to meeting. Dissertation committees will consist of a minimum of three faculty with the chair’s option to invite an outside individual to serve as a fourth, non-voting member. The Chair of the committee must be KSU Graduate Faculty associated with the student’s program. If the chair invites a committee member from outside the university to sit on a dissertation committee, the outside member may be a collaborating P-12 professional, state or accrediting agency employee, faculty member at another institution, or an individual who holds unique skills or expertise related to the dissertation; however, this individual may not serve as chair. Any outside individual invited to serve must meet criteria for graduate faculty status as established by the Graduate College. Once the committee is selected, the student completes the Request for Approval of the Thesis/Dissertation Committee form and obtains appropriate signatures. KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 14 Note: Once the dissertation committee is finalized, it is highly irregular for the committee membership to change. Should there be extenuating circumstances that warrant a change in membership, however, a Request for Change in Dissertation Committee Membership form must be completed. Comprehensive Examination. The comprehensive examination provides doctoral students with the opportunity to demonstrate their level of knowledge in a selected field of study and to synthesize that knowledge into a professionally written document. Written comprehensive examinations are taken after the completion of doctoral course work. Individual programs may allow students to take 1-2 courses in the same semester as comprehensive exams but all research courses must be complete. To schedule comprehensive exams, the student must complete and submit (with faculty signatures) the Doctoral Comprehensive Examination Request form. Comprehensive exams consist of 2-3 questions drafted by the student’s dissertation committee. These questions may be used to inform Chapters 1-3 of the students’ dissertation proposal. The dissertation chair may invite the student to assist in shaping these questions. At the chair’s discretion, questions may be answered on-site or in an off-campus setting: On site: Students will compose their responses on campus in a secured environment and will not be permitted to use resource materials. Other guidelines for testing will be distributed well in advance of the examination sessions and established by the dissertation committee. Written responses to all questions must be completed during one eight-hour writing session. Off campus: Questions may be written at home over a specified period as determined by the student’s dissertation committee. The off-campus format provides access to additional resources and implies a higher level of expectation for responses, including more thorough coverage of citations, greater depth and breadth of content coverage, and attention to the conventions that exemplify the characteristics of a high-quality, polished professional writing product. All dissertation committee members will read the questions administered and will evaluate the responses by providing written feedback and/or comments. The responses will be deemed as “pass” or “fail.” Students must earn a minimum rate of “pass” from all committee members. Upon successful completion of the comprehensive examination, students must complete and submit (with faculty signatures) the Doctoral Comprehensive Examination Approval Ballot form. Students must then enroll in dissertation hours and prepare to write the dissertation proposal under the guidance of their dissertation chair and committee. KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 15 Dissertation Proposal. During the candidate’s first semester of dissertation hours, the candidate, under the direction of the dissertation committee chair, completes the written proposal, and later orally defends the proposal before the dissertation committee. Under the direction of the dissertation chair, and in consultation with the committee, the candidate completes a dissertation proposal outlining in detail all aspects of the research project being proposed. The dissertation chair and committee have discretion regarding the format of the proposal. Typically, the proposal consists of Chapters 1-3: Chapter One: Introduction (problem statement, purpose, research questions) Chapter Two: Conceptual Framework and Literature Review Chapter Three: Research Design and Methodology Once the proposal is completed, the candidate will meet with the chair to schedule an oral defense of the proposal. At the completion of the oral defense, the committee may render one of several decisions: (a) the proposal is accepted; (b) the proposal is accepted with stated qualifications; or (c) the proposal is rejected in its present form, but may be revised and resubmitted at a later date and another oral defense will be held. When the dissertation committee members are satisfied with the proposal, they will sign and submit the Thesis/Dissertation Proposal Approval Form and the Application for Admissions to Candidacy Form, which designates the student’s advancement to Doctoral Candidacy. All dissertation committee members must sign the form before the proposal may be considered accepted. Human Subjects Review Application. Concurrent with the dissertation proposal approval process, the doctoral candidate will compose an Application for Approval of Research Project Involving Human Subjects form, which is to be forwarded to the Kennesaw State University Institutional Review Board (IRB). This application is subject to the committee’s approval of the student’s methods; therefore, it is advisable that the student time his/her submission of the IRB application very close to, or immediately following, the proposal defense. If the research involves individuals at a school site, review and approval of the research is also required from school district officials. Doctoral candidates must have a certificate indicating that they have completed the required (CITI) training course before submitting a proposal to the IRB. This certificate should be secured prior to approval of the dissertation proposal, ensuring that the student is familiar with the Human Subjects Review process prior to the defense. The dissertation chair must approve the Human Subjects Review application before submitting it on behalf of the student to the IRB Review Board. Students should also KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 16 visit the Kennesaw State University Human Subjects Review webpage and the IRB website for further details on this process: http://research.kennesaw.edu/irb/. It is the policy of Kennesaw State University IRB that no data may be collected for the dissertation research prior to the approval of the Human Subjects Review application. Likewise, most school districts and/or private schools also require a separate Human Subjects Review process. It is the responsibility of the doctoral student to verify with the school and/or district in which research is to take place that the required IRB approval (at the school district level) has been secured prior to conducting any data collection for the dissertation research. The student, in consultation with the dissertation chair, will write and sign a letter to the district and/or school, stating that the proposed research is part of the doctoral student’s dissertation study. The doctoral student must provide to the dissertation chair proof (e.g., a certificate or official letter of permission) of district and/or school approval for the research to be conducted within the school and/or district. The doctoral student must also file the school district’s official IRB approval with Kennesaw State University’s IRB. If the district does not have an official IRB process in place, the student must complete and submit an IRB application through KSU. Dissertation and Final Defense. All dissertations submitted by candidates for the Doctorate of Education (Ed.D.) in the Bagwell College of Education must comply with current American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines. Other requirements may be specified by the KSU Graduate College. Strict timelines are in place for the submission of all dissertation related documents. Doctoral candidates are required to adhere to these timelines. While the dissertation committee may offer suggestions for revision, the doctoral student is ultimately responsible for review of the dissertation manuscript for adherence to all APA guidelines.

The student will provide a final draft of the dissertation to each of the dissertation committee members at least 30 days before the defense. This final draft must be complete in all respects and editorially acceptable for final approval at the time of the defense. Failure to comply with this procedure will result in a delay of the defense. The defense is posted as a public hearing and may be attended by other members of the University community and, as reasonable in the judgment of the dissertation committee chair, by others from outside the University. As arranged by the dissertation chair, the dissertation committee will meet before the scheduled defense to discuss the dissertation and procedures for the defense. Whenever possible, the defense should be scheduled in a room that will accommodate visitors comfortably. The dissertation chair establishes matters of protocol prior to the actual defense. Faculty and any others who sit in as an audience for the defense are required to defer to the dissertation chair’s judgment concerning matters of protocol. The public defense provides a formal opportunity for the doctoral candidate to present his/her research questions, design, methods, findings, and conclusions to those in attendance. Generally, this presentation by the candidate will last from between 30-45 minutes. The dissertation committee will formally question the doctoral candidate about the work he/she has completed. Generally, the dissertation defense will not exceed two hours in duration. Once the candidate has completed his/her public presentation, the dissertation chair will dismiss the audience in order to conduct a private questioning of the candidate, followed by a final discussion of the dissertation work and vote on the quality of that work without the candidate present. That is, the dissertation committee’s final deliberations will take place in Executive Session, with only the dissertation committee members present. Only dissertation committee members may express opinions or vote on the outcome of the defense. The dissertation committee members will vote on whether the candidate passed or failed the final dissertation defense. Once the vote is taken, the dissertation chair invites the candidate to return to the room. The candidate is the only person who returns to the room after the dissertation committee’s deliberations. The committee’s final decision and any additional feedback from the dissertation committee is presented to the candidate at this time. Generally, immediately following the announcement to the candidate of the results of the dissertation committee’s deliberations, the candidate may expect the dissertation committee to make suggestions for revision and final edits. The doctoral student and dissertation committee should schedule their time to be available to discuss these revisions and edits at this time. It is the responsibility of the doctoral student to make KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 18 personal written notes about the suggested revisions and, subsequently, to complete all edits. The dissertation chair completes the Thesis/Dissertation Defense Outcome form signifying any additional edits or final changes that need to be made in the dissertation document. All committee members must sign the form prior to leaving the dissertation defense. In the event a student does not successfully defend, he/she may re-defend within six (6) months of the initial defense. A candidate may have only one additional attempt to defend and to pass the defense of the dissertation. Failure to re-defend within six (6) months or failure to pass the second dissertation defense results in the candidate’s dismissal from the program without the awarding of the Ed.D. degree. Copyright of Dissertation. Candidates may choose to copyright their dissertation when submitting their final copy to Digital Commons. Regardless of whether the doctoral student copyrights the dissertation, the candidate is responsible for complying with all current copyright laws and regulations governing inclusion of another's work in his or her work. Submitting the Completed Dissertation to Digital Commons. All BCOE doctoral students are required to submit their completed dissertations to Digital Commons, the digital repository for scholarly work at Kennesaw State University. Final dissertations should be submitted to http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/etds.html. Publishing Manuscripts from the Dissertation. Doctoral students frequently collaborate with faculty who have made substantive contributions to the dissertation. In all cases, however, the author of the dissertation should be listed as the first author on any paper and/or publication based primarily on the dissertation research that is submitted for publication (see APA Ethical Principles). Dissertation Awards. Graduate students are also advised that numerous professional organizations present competitive awards for outstanding dissertation research, including the BCOE Outstanding Dissertation Award. Upon completion and approval of the dissertation, doctoral students should consult with their dissertation chair and/or committee members about requirements and submissions for such awards. XI. Petition to Graduate and Commencement Each candidate for a doctoral degree must petition to graduate online well in advance of the expected graduation date. A Petition to Graduate form will be accepted and may be filed by the posted deadlines using the online Petition to Graduate form in OwlExpress. A student must complete at least 75% of the total semester hours required for the degree in residence at KSU. Degree candidates must have earned an institutional grade KSU BCOE Doctoral Policies and Procedures Handbook, page 19 point average of 3.0 calculated on all graduate courses attempted at KSU and a grade of "C" or better in each course presented to meet degree requirements. Students should check with the Registrar to ensure no grades of “Incomplete” remain on their transcript, that they have completed all program and Bagwell College of Education requirements (i.e., Petition to Graduate), all fees are paid, and that they are on the graduation clearance list. These checks ensure the graduation process will go smoothly. Students can also check most of this information online. Students will follow graduation procedures as outlined by the university. During KSU Commencement, Bagwell College of Education doctoral graduates and faculty participate in a university-wide Doctoral Hooding Ceremony. Names of doctoral candidates and dissertation chairs, along with the titles of dissertations, are announced, and candidates are hooded by their dissertation chair. Candidates’ names, dissertation chairs’ names, and dissertation titles are provided in the official commencement program. Doctoral regalia are available in the KSU Bookstore and may be purchased or rented. The regalia are featured on the KSU Bookstore website in advance of graduation. XII. Important Doctoral Forms for Students and Faculty All Dissertation Forms (both BCOE and Graduate College forms) are located on the BCOE website on both the “Current Students” tab and the “Faculty and Staff” tab. All forms should be completed and sent to Department Chairs for signatures. All completed forms should then be sent to the BCOE Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research, who will review and approve each form, save the forms to the BCOE Dean’s Office I: drive, and forward forms to the Graduate College, when appropriate. Please ensure that forms have signatures as well as printed names beside the signatures on the form. We must be able to read committee chair and committee members’ names on the forms.

﻿Doctoral Degrees Policies 1 DOCTORAL DEGREES POLICIES Credit Requirements The Doctoral Dissertation and Examination A dissertation is required of all candidates for a doctoral degree. The Graduate School has established the following procedures for the conduct of the doctoral dissertation examination. The Graduate School requires that every student seeking the Ph.D. or D.M.A. satisfactorily complete a minimum of 12 semester hours of dissertation credits (899); a student seeking an Ed.D. must satisfactorily complete a minimum of six semester hours of dissertation credits (899). The number of research and other credit hours required in the program varies with the degree and program in question. Advancement to Candidacy Preliminary examinations, or such other substantial tests as the graduate programs may elect, are prerequisites for advancement to candidacy. A student must be admitted to candidacy for the doctorate within five years after admission to the doctoral program and at least six months before the date on which the degree will be conferred. It is the responsibility of the student to submit an application for admission to candidacy when all the requirements for candidacy have been fulfilled. Applications for admission to candidacy are made in duplicate by the student and submitted to the graduate program for further action and transmission to the Graduate School . Application forms may be obtained at the Graduate School, Room 2123, Lee Building, or on the web. Paperwork must be received by the Graduate School prior to the 25th of the month in order for the advancement to become effective the first day of the following month. Doctoral candidates are automatically registered for six (6) credits of Doctoral Dissertation Research (899), for which they pay the flat candidacy tuition. Research Assurances Human Subject Research Everyone at the University of Maryland who is conducting research that involves human subjects must obtain approval in advance from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is charged with approving the initiation of research involving human subjects and conducts periodic reviews of that research to ensure that all projects comply with Federal regulations. These regulations are strict, and the Graduate School urges all graduate students to consult with the IRB before beginning any research involving living subjects. For application forms and guidelines on such issues as research involving minors or prisoners, surveys, and the use of audio taping, videotaping, digital recordings, and photographs, please see the Institutional Review Board's website (http:// www.umresearch.umd.edu/IRB). Other Research If the dissertation research involves the use of vertebrate animals, animal use protocols must be approved in advance by the Animal Care and Use Committee. If the dissertation research involves hazardous materials, either biological or chemical, or recombinant RNA/DNA, the research must be approved by the appropriate University committee. These research assurances must be approved prior to the initiation of any dissertation-related research, and the approvals must be provided to the Graduate School at the time the student submits the Nomination of Examining Committee form. • The Dissertation. The ability to do independent research must be demonstrated by an original dissertation on a topic approved by the graduate program in which the student is earning the degree. • Eligibility. A student is eligible to defend a dissertation if the student (a) has advanced to candidacy, (b) has met all program requirements for a dissertation examination, (c) is in good standing as a graduate student at the University, (d) is registered for at least one credit, (e) has a valid Graduate School-approved Dissertation Examining Committee, and (f) if this is the second examination, the examination has been approved by the Graduate School. • Dissertation Examining Committee Membership. The Committee must include a minimum of five members of the Graduate Faculty, at least three of whom must be Full Members. The Chair of the Committee normally will be the student's advisor, who will be a Full Member of the Graduate Faculty, or who has been granted an exception to the policy by the Dean of the Graduate School. Each Committee will have appointed to it a representative of the Dean of the Graduate School. The Dean's Representative may be one of the five voting members. Alternatively, the Dean's Representative may not be a voting member of the Committee. Whether the Dean's Representative votes or not is a decision made by the student, primary advisor and the Dean's Representative before the Dean's Representative is nominated for approval by the Dean of The Graduate School. In addition, the Dean will ensure that there are five voting members on the Committee. Therefore, Committees that have a non-voting Dean's Representative must have at least six members (five voting members and the non-voting Dean's Representative.) • Nomination of the Dissertation Examining Committee. Membership on a Dissertation Examining Committee requires nomination by the student's advisor and the Graduate Director of the student's graduate program, and approval by the Dean of the Graduate School. The nomination of a Dissertation Examining Committee should be provided to the Graduate School at least six weeks before the date of the expected dissertation examination. The dissertation examination cannot be held until the Graduate School approves the composition of the Dissertation Examining Committee. Furthermore, if the Graduate Faculty status of any member of an approved Dissertation Examining Committee changes, the approval of the Dissertation Examining Committee may be void, and a new Dissertation Examining Committee nomination form may be required to be approved by the Graduate School. • Chair. Each Dissertation Examining Committee will have a chair, who must be a Full Member of the Graduate Faculty or, by special permission, has been otherwise appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School . Dissertation Examining Committees may be cochaired upon written recommendation of the program's Graduate Director and with the approval of the Dean of the Graduate School; at least one of the co-chairs must be a Full Member of the University of Maryland Graduate Faculty. • Representative of the Dean of the Graduate School. Each Dissertation Examining Committee will have appointed to it a representative of the Dean of the Graduate School. The Dean's Representative should have some background or interest related to the student's research. The Dean's Representative must be a tenured member of 2 Doctoral Degrees Policies the Graduate Faculty at the University of Maryland, College Park. The Dean's Representative must be from another tenure home than the student's primary advisor, or co-advisor(s). In the case of multidisciplinary programs, the Dean's Representative can be a member of the program, as long as they have a different tenure home from the primary advisor, co-advisor(s), or Doctoral Committee Chair (if the Doctoral Committee Chair is not a primary advisor). The person nominated to become the Dean's Representative may serve as a regular member of the student's Doctoral Graduate Committee from the time it is first convened. Alternatively, the person nominated to be the Dean's representative may be added to the Doctoral Graduate Committee at a later date and either take part in some Committee meetings including the qualifying examination, or only join as a Doctoral Dissertation Committee member for the final dissertation defense. In all cases, the Dean's Representative must be present for the full dissertation defense and serve to adjudicate the defense. • Special Members. Individuals from outside the University of Maryland who have been approved for Special Membership in the Graduate Faculty may serve on Dissertation Examining Committees. These Special Members must be in addition to the required three Full Members of the University of Maryland Graduate Faculty. For procedures to nominate an individual for Special Membership, please refer to the section below on Graduate Faculty. • Service of former University of Maryland faculty members. Graduate Faculty who terminate employment at University of Maryland (and who do not have emeritus status) retain their status as members of the Graduate Faculty for a twelve-month period following their termination. Thus, they may serve as members and chairs (but not as Dean's Representatives) of Dissertation Examining Committees during this twelve-month period if they are otherwise eligible. After that time, they may no longer serve as chairs of Dissertation Examining Committees, although, if granted the status of Special Members of the Graduate Faculty, they may serve as co-chairs. • Professors Emeriti and Associate Professors Emeriti may serve on Dissertation Examining Committees provided they are members of the Graduate Faculty. Open Dissertation Examination The dissertation examination will consist of two parts: • Part 1 will be a public presentation by the candidate on the main aspects of the research reported in the dissertation. During Part 1, questions from the audience to the candidate will be permitted. For questions from persons who are not members of the Dissertation Examining Committee, the Chair of the Dissertation Examining Committee will have discretion to decide whether such questions are germane to the topic of the dissertation and how much time will be allotted for the answers. • Part 2 will be a formal examination of the candidate by the Dissertation Examination Committee. This part will be open only to the Dissertation Examination Committee, other members of the Graduate Faculty, and graduate students from the candidate's graduate program. During Part 2, only members of the Dissertation Examination Committee will be permitted to ask questions. Programs may vote to establish a policy to have Part 2 be open only to members of the Dissertation Examining Committee and members of the Graduate Faculty. • Attendance at the final discussion and vote will be limited to the members of the Dissertation Examining Committee. • Announcements of the date, time, and location of the examination, as well as the candidate's name and the dissertation title, will be disseminated five working days in advance to all members of the Graduate Faculty and graduate students within the graduate program in which the candidate's degree is to be awarded. Mass-distribution methods, such as e-mail, a faculty/student newsletter, or individual announcements are acceptable. Merely posting a paper notice on a corridor bulletin board will not constitute a sufficient announcement. • Departments and graduate programs may petition the Dean of the Graduate School for exceptions to these policies. Procedures for the Oral Dissertation Examination • Oral Examination Requirement. Each doctoral candidate is required to defend orally his or her doctoral dissertation as a requirement in partial fulfillment of the doctoral degree. • Committee Preparation. The members of the Dissertation Examining Committee must receive the dissertation at least ten working days before the scheduled examination. Should the Dissertation Examining Committee deem it reasonable and appropriate, it may require submission of the dissertation more than ten working days in advance of the examination. • Attendance at the Examination. Oral examinations must be attended by all members of the student's officially established Dissertation Examining Committee as approved by the Dean of the Graduate School. All examinations must be open to all members of the University of Maryland Graduate Faculty. Programs may wish routinely to open dissertation examinations to a broader audience. In such cases, program policies must be established, recorded, and made available to all doctoral students. Should a last-minute change in the constitution of the Dissertation Examining Committee be required, the change must be approved by the Dean of the Graduate School in consultation with the Graduate Director of the student's graduate program and the chair of the student's Dissertation Examining Committee. • Location of the Examination. Oral examinations must be held in University facilities that are readily accessible to all members of the Dissertation Examining Committee and others attending the examination. The chair of the dissertation examining committee selects the time and place for the examination. • The Dean's Representative. The Dean's Representative must be identified at the beginning of the examination. The responsibilities of the Dean's Representative include the following: ensuring that the procedures of the oral examination comply with those of the Graduate School (as described herein) and reporting to the Dean of the Graduate School any unusual problems experienced in the conduct of the examination. • Invalidation of the Examination. The Dean of the Graduate School may void any examination not carried out in accordance with the procedures and policies of the Graduate School . In addition, upon recommendation of the Dean's Representative, the Dean may rule an oral examination to be null and void. • Emergency Substitution Procedure. The Graduate School is aware that last-minute emergencies can prevent a committee member from attending a scheduled dissertation examination and will work with the chair of the examining committee and/or Graduate Director to make last-minute substitutions in committee membership to allow the examination to take place as scheduled. Doctoral Degrees Policies 3 • The request must be sent in writing to the Dean of the Graduate School . Fax or e-mail requests are acceptable. A telephone call to the Graduate School explaining that an emergency request is coming will facilitate the process. • The Dean’s Representative is responsible for ensuring that all requirements for remote participation are met, that the remote participation was uninterrupted, and if interrupted, that the defense was paused until all remote participations were fully restored. • The proposed substitute must be a member of the Graduate Faculty consistent with the rules for committee membership. Thus, if the Dean's Representative (who must be a tenured faculty member) could not attend, the substitution of an untenured member of the Graduate Faculty would not be acceptable. • Once the written request has been received, the substitution will be made, usually within the hour, provided that the revised committee meets the requirements for committee membership. • When the substitution has been made, a written confirmation, in the same format as the request was received (fax or e-mail) will be sent out, along with a telephone confirmation. The substitution is not official, however, until the written confirmation has been received in the graduate program. • An examination that is held with one or more substitute members on the committee, but without prior written confirmation from the Graduate School that the substitution(s) have been approved, will be voided and the examination will have to be repeated. • A copy of the written request and the written confirmation must be placed in the student's file for future reference. • Remote Participation in a Dissertation Defense. Under normal circumstances, all members of a Dissertation Examining Committee must be physically present in the examination room during the entire dissertation defense and during the committee's private deliberations following the examination. Participation by telephone is not permitted under any circumstances. Remote participation by video teleconferencing is permitted under the following circumstances: • Permission to conduct a remote-participation defense must be obtained by the dissertation chair from the Graduate School in advance. In making this request, the chair must indicate in writing that he or she has read the rules for a remote defense listed below. • Approved web-conferencing software must be used that allows all participants to see and hear each other during the entire defense. • The candidate, the committee chair (or at least one of the cochairs), and the Dean’s Representative must all be present in the examination room; none may be at a remote site. • If necessary, other members of the committee may participate from one or more remote sites as long as the conferencing software supports the rules of the conduct of the defense. Permission for remote participation must be approved in advance by the Dean of the Graduate School. The request for remote participation must provide a compelling reason and/or explanation as to why each remote committee member cannot be physically present. • The program must pay for any costs associated with the remote participation. The remote participants must connect to the defense using hardware that will ensure that all participants are visible and audible and that the connection is stable and available throughout the scheduled time of the defense. • Student Presentation. The student is permitted to present briefly a summary of the dissertation, emphasizing the important results and giving an explanation of the reasoning that led to the conclusions reached. • Opportunity for Questioning by Members of the Dissertation Examining Committee. The chair invites questions in turn from each member of the Dissertation Examining Committee. The questioning may continue as long as the Dissertation Examining Committee feels that it is necessary and reasonable for the proper examination of the student. • Conclusion of the Examination. After questioning has been completed, the student and any others who are not members of the Dissertation Examining Committee are asked to leave the room while the Dissertation Examining Committee discusses whether or not the dissertation and its defense are satisfactory. The Committee has the following options: • To accept the dissertation without any recommended changes and sign the Report of Examining Committee. • To accept the dissertation with recommendations for changes and, except for the chair, sign the Report of the Examining Committee. The chair will check that the changes to the dissertation have been made, and, upon his or her approval, sign the Report of Examining Committee. • To recommend revisions to the dissertation and not sign the Report of Examining Committee until the student has made the changes and submitted the revised dissertation for the Dissertation Examining Committee's approval. The Dissertation Examining Committee members sign the Report of Examining Committee if they approve the revised dissertation. • To recommend revisions and convene a second meeting of the Dissertation Examining Committee to review the dissertation and complete the student's examination. • To rule the dissertation (including its examination) unsatisfactory. In that circumstance, the student fails. Following the examination, the chair, in the presence of the Dean's Representative, must inform the student of the outcome of the examination. The chair and the Dean's Representative both sign a Report of the Examining Committee indicating which of the above alternatives has been adopted. A copy of this statement is to be included in the student's file at the graduate program office, and a copy is given to the student. • Passage or failure. The student passes if one member refuses to sign the Report, but the other members of the Dissertation Examining Committee agree to sign, before or after the approval of recommended changes. Two or more negative votes constitute a failure of the candidate to meet the dissertation requirement. In cases of failure, the Dissertation Examining Committee must specify in detail and in writing the nature of the deficiencies in the dissertation and/or the oral performance that led to failure. This statement is to be submitted to the program's Graduate Director, the Dean of the Graduate School, and the student. A second examination may be permitted if the student will be in good standing at the time of the proposed second examination. A second examination requires the approval of the program's Graduate Director and the Dean of the 4 Doctoral Degrees Policies Graduate School . If the student fails this second examination, or if a second examination is not permitted, the student's admission to the graduate program is terminated. Submission and Publication of the Dissertation Dissertations are to be submitted to the Graduate School in electronic format after final approval of the dissertation by the Dissertation Examining Committee. See the University of Maryland Electronic Thesis and Dissertation (ETD) website (http://www.dissertations.umi.com/umd)or the University of Maryland Thesis and Dissertation Style Guide (http:// www.gradschool.umd.edu/current_students/etd_style_guide.html) for the details of this process. Dissertations submitted to the University through the ETD process will also be deposited in the UM Library's online electronic archive, DRUM (Digital Repository at the University of Maryland (http:// drum.lib.umd.edu)) (http://drum.lib.umd.edu). This is a free public archive of academic work by University faculty and graduate students. The submission of the thesis to the University in fulfillment of degree requirements grants the University the one-time, non-exclusive right to publish the document on DRUM. The students' and University's rights regarding dissertation and thesis submission and publication are outlined below. The University's Rights The University of Maryland retains non-exclusive distribution, reproduction, and archival rights to doctoral dissertations submitted to the Graduate Faculty in fulfillment of requirements for a graduate degree. Such rights entitle the University of Maryland to reproduce, archive, and distribute dissertations, in whole or in part, in and from an electronic format, as it sees fit. Distribution is subject to a release date stipulated by the student and approved by the University. The Student's Rights and Responsibilities As the owner of copyright in the thesis or dissertation, students have the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, make derivative works based on, publicly perform and display their work, and to authorize others to exercise some or all of those rights. As a condition of graduation, each student's thesis or dissertation must be published. When the student submits his or her work to the Graduate School, they will be given several options regarding access to their document via ProQuest's Digital Dissertations and DRUM, the Digital Repository at the University of Maryland. The student's options include: • Making the thesis or dissertation available via ProQuest and DRUM as soon as it is received The abstract and full text of your work will be present in ProQuest's Digital Dissertations for purchase, and will be both freely available and searchable online via DRUM. • Restrict online publication of the thesis or dissertation for either 1 or 6 years Students may place an embargo (a restriction) on electronic access to your document through ProQuest's Digital Dissertations and DRUM if there is legitimate reason to do so. Patents or future publication, for example, might be jeopardized by providing unrestricted access (see below). Should a student elect to restrict online publication of his or her work, a description of the research, including the student's name, the document's title, the advisor's name, and the abstract will be available via ProQuest and DRUM, but the actual electronic file will be unavailable for viewing or download until the selected embargo period has passed. • Restrict online publication of the dissertation indefinitely Students may, in rare circumstances, place an indefinite embargo on access to their work. In this case, a description of the thesis or dissertation, including the student's name, the work's title, the advisor's name, and the abstract will be available via ProQuest's Digital Dissertations and DRUM, but the actual electronic file will be embargoed indefinitely. This option requires the written approval of the Dean of the Graduate School . This restriction can be lifted at the request of the author at a later date. Inclusion of One's Own Previously Published Materials in a Dissertation A graduate student may, upon the recommendation of the dissertation director, and with the endorsement of the home graduate program's Graduate Director, include his or her own published works as part of the final dissertation. Appropriate citations within the dissertation, including where the work was previously published, are required. All such materials must be produced in standard dissertation format . It is recognized that a graduate student may co-author work with faculty members and colleagues that should be included in a dissertation. In such an event, a letter should be sent to the Dean of the Graduate School certifying that the student's examining committee has determined that the student made a substantial contribution to that work. This letter should also note that inclusion of the work has the approval of the dissertation advisor and the program chair or Graduate Director. The letter should be included with the dissertation at the time of submission. The format of such inclusions must conform to the standard dissertation format. A foreword to the dissertation, as approved by the Dissertation Committee, must state that the student made substantial contributions to the relevant aspects of the jointly authored work included in the dissertation. Inclusion of Copyrighted Materials in a Dissertation Students are responsible for ensuring that their thesis or dissertation complies with copyright law.

1. SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING—POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
1.1 Admission Eligibility 
The eligibility criteria are as follows: 
- Applicants with first-class (minimum of 65% marks) in the following degrees are eligible to apply for admission to the Ph.D. Programme: B.E., B.Tech., M.E., M.Tech., M.Sc., MCA. The PGP Chairs in Engineering shall evaluate, as needed, whether any other degree, including a degree from a foreign university, can be considered as equivalent to one of the above degrees for the purpose of admission. 
- All applicants are expected to have strong academic records. Applicants with only a Bachelors degree should show additional evidence, such as excellent scores on standardized aptitude tests (e.g. GRE, GATE) or publications in good conferences or journals. 
1.2 Categories of Doctoral Students 
There are two categories of doctoral students, full-time and part-time. An applicant must choose, at the time of admission, the category in which he or she wishes to be admitted. 
A full-time doctoral student is primarily focused on carrying out at the University all course-work, research, and other doctoral requirements. The student may be employed on a research project that has his or her Thesis Advisor (see section 2.2) as PI/Co-PI, but the research project and doctoral research should have substantial overlap. 
A part-time doctoral student typically has a full-time appointment at the University or at another academic/R&D organization. They are permitted to proceed at a slower pace in completing their doctoral requirements (see section 1.4). 
1.3 Course-work Credits 
The number of course-work credits that a doctoral student undertakes is decided by the Doctoral Committee (see section 2.2) and depends upon the student’s background and intended Ph.D. research area. 
All students must complete a 1-credit course on Research Methodology and a non- credit course on Mathematical Foundations (see Annexure 1). In addition: 
- students entering with B.E., B.Tech. or equivalent degrees must complete a 
minimum of 36 credits of PG-level course-work; - students entering with M.Sc and MCA must complete a minimum of 21 credits 
of PG-level course-work; and - students entering with M.E., M.Tech, or equivalent degrees must complete a 
minimum of 12 credits of PG-level course-work. 
3 
All students must complete a 3-credit Minor course, i.e., one that falls outside the student’s research area. This course could be from the same school as that of the student (but different department) or it could be from a different school. When a student’s intended research area is interdisciplinary or the student’s entering degree is from a different discipline, the Doctoral Committee may petition the PGP Chair for substitution of the Minor course with another course. The credits for the Minor course or its substitute are included in the above-mentioned course-work credits. 
When necessary, the Doctoral Committee may prescribe more course-work credits than the minimum number of credits stated above. 
1.4 Normal Duration of Ph.D. 
The normal duration for the Ph.D. depends upon the student’s qualifications at the time of admission and also the category of admission. 
- For full-time doctoral students entering with an M.E., M.Tech or equivalent 
degrees, the normal duration for the Ph.D. is four years, the minimum being three years and maximum being six years. - For full-time doctoral students entering with a B.E., B.Tech, M.Sc, MCA or 
equivalent degrees, the corresponding periods are five, four, and seven years, respectively. - For part-time doctoral students, the normal duration for the Ph.D. is between 
five and eight years. 
Under special circumstances, the PGP Chair may approve deviations from the normal period of completion based upon a written justification provided by the Thesis Advisor and approved by the Doctoral Committee. 
A doctoral student who registers and successfully completes all requirements in the School of Engineering will receive a Ph.D. degree under the Faculty of Engineering. 
2. UNIVERSITY-WIDE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
2.1 Admission Procedure 
Applications for the Ph.D. Programme will be solicited through the university website (www.amrita.edu) and other means of advertisement, and admissions shall take place twice a year on dates that are announced well in advance. 
The PGP Chair shall authorize a Department/Centre or a group of Departments/Centres to form a Selection Committee taking into account the number of available openings, the number of applications received and the research interests of the applicants. The Selection Committee will conduct a common Entrance Test for all applicants, followed by an Interview. 
The Entrance Test will examine fundamental concepts and the syllabus of the Test will be made known to the applicants in advance. The Interview examines the applicant’s 
4 
interests, aptitude, and background. The Selection Committee may request additional evidence, such as copies of claimed publications, at the Interview. 
Based upon the Entrance Test and Interview performance, and prior academic record, the Committee shall give its recommendation to the PGP Chair who will finalize the admission and notify the selected applicants of the date of joining. 
All prospective Thesis Advisors are invited to participate in the selection process and their consent obtained before being appointed as Thesis Advisor for any applicant. 
2.2 Thesis Advisor and Doctoral Committee 
Soon upon admission to the Ph.D. Programme, every student shall be assigned a Thesis Advisor and a Doctoral Committee by the PGP Chair taking into account the student’s interests and available faculty. 
The Thesis Advisor must be a regular or emeritus faculty member of the University with a Ph.D. degree and an established research record. The Thesis Advisor is primarily responsible for guiding the doctoral student’s research and ensuring that the student makes satisfactory and timely progress towards the Ph.D. degree. 
A Thesis Advisor may not advise more than five doctoral students at a time, and, in exceptional cases, not more than eight students at a time. Junior faculty of the university, especially first-time advisors, may serve as Thesis Advisor provided a senior faculty member is associated as a Co-Advisor. Adjunct faculty members of the University may serve only as Co-Advisors. 
A faculty member from one campus of the University may serve as Thesis Advisor for a doctoral student in another campus. In such cases, the faculty member should keep his or her Department Chair informed of the arrangement. Occasionally, when it is desirable to have an external expert as Co-Advisor, the PGP Chair shall recommend (to Vice chancellor) that the expert be appointed as an Adjunct faculty of the University, and, subsequent to that appointment, shall appoint him or her to the Doctoral Committee. 
The Doctoral Committee consists of the Thesis Advisor, the Co-Advisor (where applicable), a Convener, and one or two experts from within the University in the candidate’s research area. The doctoral committee shall have a total of four to five members. (In Schools with a small number of PhD-holding faculty, the Doctoral Committee may have three members.) Each member of the Doctoral Committee must have a Ph.D. The Doctoral Committee is responsible for all academic matters connected with the doctoral student, including prescribing the course-work, monitoring research progress, and conducting appropriate examinations. 
Changes in Thesis Advisor and/or Doctoral Committee are permitted after the doctoral student passes the Comprehensive Examination (see section 2.3.4). Under special circumstances, such changes may be permitted at any stage. If the request is due to a change in research topic, the (new) Doctoral Committee shall ensure that the student 
5 
acquires adequate knowledge to proceed with the research programme. Such changes are to be approved by the PGP Chair. 
2.3 Ph.D. Degree Requirements 
2.3.1 Course Work 
The course-work for a doctoral student is proposed by the Thesis Advisor taking into account the student’s background and preparation. The proposed course-work must be endorsed by the Doctoral Committee and approved by the PGP Chair. 
All courses shall be University-approved courses. The student is expected to maintain an average grade of “B” across all courses. In addition to regular courses offered by the University, three additional types of courses are permitted: transfer courses, on-line courses, and independent-study courses. 
- A transfer course is one that the student has completed in the recent past at the University (prior to admission) or at another reputed institution. A course completed for the award of another degree is not eligible for transfer. 
- An on-line course is one that is offered in distance-learning mode by another educational institution or a reputable education-technology company such as Coursera, EdX, and Udacity. Such courses require prior approval by the student’s Doctoral Committee. It requires registration in a ‘Special Studies’ course at the University, completion of 45 hours of on-line lectures, and obtaining a pass grade on a final examination set by the Doctoral Committee and administered by the Controller of Examinations. The evaluation of on-line courses shall be similar to other courses. 
- An independent-study course is developed specifically for the Ph.D. student and may involve a combination of self-study and one-to-one instruction by a professor. Such a course should not have substantial overlap with a regular lecture course offered by the University. A student taking an independent- study course must complete a publishable Scopus-indexed conference or journal paper for successful completion of the course. 
Up to 50% of a student’s course-work may consist of the above three types of courses. 
2.3.2 Thesis Work 
In addition to course-work, the doctoral student is expected to carry out creative and scholarly research leading up to the completion of a written Ph.D. Thesis. Doctoral research must result in original and substantial contributions to the chosen specialized field of study. This requires mastery of the literature in the specialized field, and critical thinking and judgment. The student should also relate the field of study to the broader discipline within which the research falls. 
In recognition of the substantial nature of Ph.D. thesis work, it will carry 60 credits. Full- time doctoral students shall register for 10-15 credits per semester, while part-time 
6 
students may register for 6-10 credits each semester. Satisfactory progress in thesis work will result in an ‘O’ grade (for ongoing) and unsatisfactory progress will result in an ‘I’ grade (for incomplete), which is to be made up within one semester. Satisfactory progress will be judged by the Doctoral Committee on the basis of semester wise progress reports submitted by the doctoral student (see section 2.3.11) and/or the completion of publishable papers (see section 2.3.5). A student is not permitted to obtain ‘I’ grades in two consecutive semesters. 
2.3.3 Residency Requirement 
Every doctoral student must fulfill a minimum residency period of one academic year in the University including the time spent on course work. 
Part-time students who are employed external to the University must also fulfill the one- year residency requirement. However, this can be met through multiple (up to a maximum of five) visits, with at least one semester/trimester of continuous stay at the campus. It is recommended that such students undertake course-work for at least one semester/trimester at the University. 
2.3.4 Comprehensive Examination 
All doctoral students must take a Comprehensive Examination after completion of all course-work. This is normally done by full-time /part-time students within two/ three years after registration in the Ph.D. Programme. The Comprehensive Examination is an oral (in some Schools, a written-cum-oral) examination administered by the Doctoral Committee and examines the course work undergone by the candidate. 
The Doctoral Committee frames the syllabus for the examination and may invite an additional expert from within the University who, together with the Doctoral Committee, form the Comprehensive Examination Committee. The Convener of the Doctoral Committee will be the Convener of the Comprehensive Examination Committee. No external examiner is required for the Comprehensive Examination. 
If a doctoral student fails in the first attempt, he or she will be given a second chance to take the examination after a period of three months, but within six months. Extra time may be recommended by the Doctoral Committee and granted by the PGP Chair when the student needs to complete additional course-work before re-taking the examination. In special cases, the Doctoral Committee and PGP Chair may grant a third and final examination, failing which the student is required to leave the Ph.D. Programme. 
2.3.5 Publications 
After completion of the Comprehensive Examination, every doctoral student is expected to publish one refereed paper a year. These papers should be in a Scopus-indexed journal or conference proceedings. Prior to the submission of a paper to any conference or journal, a written consent should be obtained from the Chair of the Department in which the student is registered. 
7 
All publications based upon the thesis research should list the name of the Thesis Advisor and Co-Advisor, with their consent, in addition to the doctoral student’s name. The format for writing one’s affiliation in conference/journal papers is as follows: 
Names of Authors Name of Department/Centre/School Name of Campus Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (University) 
Conference publications should appear in the proceedings produced by reputed international professional bodies. The PGP Chair, in consultation with the experts in the area, will decide whether the publications are of the required quality. 
Before submission of the Thesis Synopsis (see section 2.3.8), every doctoral student is also expected to have at least one paper accepted for publication in a Scopus-indexed journal on the topic of the thesis research. 
2.3.6 Qualifying Examination and Thesis Proposal 
All doctoral students must take a Qualifying Examination. This is normally done by full- time /part-time students within one year/ two years after passing the Comprehensive Examination and after the completion of one conference/journal paper. In preparation for the Qualifying Examination, a doctoral student must submit a written Thesis Proposal to the Doctoral Committee. After approval by the committee, the student may take the Qualifying Examination, wherein he or she presents and defends the proposal. 
The Qualifying Examination is an oral examination administered by a Qualifying Examination Committee consisting of the Doctoral Committee together with an external expert from a reputed academic or R&D institution in India. The Convener of the Doctoral Committee will be the Convener of the Qualifying Examination Committee. 
The Thesis Proposal is a 12-15 page document outlining the doctoral student’s plan of research. It should include: 
(a) the research problem and its significance; (b) background and related literature; (c) objectives, approach, and results obtained to date; (d) remaining research and timeline for completion; (e) expected contributions to the field; (f) references cited 
If a doctoral student fails the Qualifying Examination in the first attempt, he or she will be given a second and final chance to take the examination after a period of time as stipulated by the Doctoral Committee and approved by the PGP Chair. A student who passes the Qualifying Examination “advances to candidacy,” i.e., becomes a Candidate for the Ph.D. degree; otherwise, the student is required to leave the Programme. 
8 
2.3.7 Open Seminars 
After advancement to candidacy, all doctoral candidates are required to present two research seminars. The two seminars should be at least six months apart, with the second seminar being held immediately before the submission of the Synopsis (see section 2.3.8). These seminars should be attended by the Thesis Advisor and Doctoral committee. The open seminars should be advertized in all departments at least a week in advance (electronically and by hardcopy) and a copy sent to the PGP Chair. Feedback and comments on the research obtained from these seminars may be suitably incorporated in the thesis. 
2.3.8 Thesis Synopsis 
Once the Thesis Advisor and Doctoral Committee are satisfied that the doctoral candidate has completed the required research for the award of the Ph.D. degree and the candidate has published (or has an acceptance of) a refereed Scopus-indexed journal paper and has also given the second Open Seminar (see section 2.3.7), the candidate is required to submit a written Synopsis to the Doctoral Committee for approval. The Synopsis should include the motivation, significance and main objectives of the research, along with a brief literature survey and a detailed report on the thesis research. The main conclusions and results should be highlighted, and important figures and references should be provided. The Synopsis should be about 12 pages; the exact format of the Synopsis may be obtained from the Office of the PGP Chair. 
The Thesis Advisor should forward to the PGP Chair an electronic and hardcopy of the Synopsis along with the name, designation, area of interest, email ids and communication address of at least eight experts who are qualified to evaluate the Thesis. Four of these experts should be from leading academic/R&D institutions in India and four from leading academic/R&D institutions from outside the country. From this list as well as other experts qualified to evaluate the thesis, the PGP Chair should obtain the consent of one expert from India and one expert from outside the country who will evaluate the thesis. 
2.3.9 Thesis Submission and Evaluation 
The doctoral candidate should submit the Ph.D. Thesis to the Doctoral Committee normally within six weeks from the date of submission of the Synopsis. The exact format of the submission may be obtained from the Office of the PGP Chair. After approval by the Doctoral Committee, the Thesis Advisor forwards an electronic and hardcopy of the Ph.D. Thesis to the PGP Chair who will send it to the external examiners. The Thesis Advisor and Co-Advisor are also invited to provide a formal evaluation of the thesis. All examiners will be given eight weeks to provide their evaluation. 
Each examiner can give one of three recommendations: (i) Accept, (ii) Accept with Modifications, or (iii) Reject. If neither of the external examiners recommends a Reject, the candidate is permitted to proceed to the Thesis Defense. If both external examiners recommend a Reject, the thesis is rejected and the candidate is required to leave the 
9 
Ph.D Programme. If only one of the external examiners recommends a Reject, the thesis is sent to a third external examiner whose evaluation decides whether or not the candidate is permitted to proceed with the Thesis Defense. Prior to the Defense, the candidate must submit a revised Thesis taking into account the comments and suggestions made by all examiners. 
2.3.10 Thesis Defense and Final Recommendation 
The Thesis Defense is a public presentation made by the doctoral candidate on the research reported in the thesis. The date, time, venue and title of the defense should be announced widely and well in advance to enable all interested parties to attend. The Thesis Defense Committee, which includes at least one external examiner and the doctoral committee members, must be present at the defense. 
The Thesis Defense Committee consists of the Doctoral Committee and at least one of the external experts who evaluated the thesis. The Convener of the Doctoral Committee serves as the Convener of this Committee. If none of the external examiners can be present, the PGP Chair may nominate a substitute examiner. 
The public defense will be followed by an in-camera (closed-door) oral examination during which the candidate is required to answer queries raised by the thesis examiners. For this purpose, all examiners’ reports will be made available to all members of the Thesis Defense Committee, who may cover the general background of the subject in the light of the requirements for the thesis. Where part of the work has been undertaken jointly with others, the examiners should satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the candidate’s own contribution. 
A pass in the in-camera oral examination is compulsory. If a candidate fails this examination in the first instance, he/she may be allowed a second and final chance after a lapse of three months, but not later than six months from the date of first appearance. If the candidate passes the oral examination, the Thesis Defense Committee shall consolidate the recommendation for the award of the PhD Degree based on the report of the examiners who evaluated the thesis as well as an evaluation of the candidate’s performance in the oral examination. The Convener forwards the consolidated recommendation to the PGP Chair who forwards the same to the PGP Dean with the required enclosures (see Annexure 2). The PGP Dean forwards the final recommendation to the Vice Chancellor for his approval. After the Vice Chancellor’s approval, the PGP Dean issues the Provisional Certificate. 
2.3.11 Progress Reports 
The doctoral student shall submit half-yearly reports to the Doctoral Committee who in turn will forward these reports along with their evaluation to the PGP Chair. The Office of the PGP Chair will maintain the format of the progress report. 
The PGP Chair may conduct periodic reviews of all doctoral students, especially those who are not making satisfactory progress, in a meeting with their Thesis Advisors and selected additional members present. Continued unsatisfactory progress, as determined by the PGP Chair, may be sufficient grounds for discontinuation of any fellowship or 
10 
assistantship that has been previously awarded to the student and also dismissal from the Ph.D. Programme. 
2.3.12 Award of the Ph.D. Degree 
Upon approval by the Vice Chancellor and subsequent ratification by the Academic Council and the Board of Management of the University, the doctoral student will be presented to the Chancellor (or Chancellor’s nominee) for award of the Ph.D. Degree at the next Convocation of the University.

I. ADMINISTRATION 
A. The Role of the Graduate Division 
The Graduate Division encompasses all post-baccalaureate advanced degree programs at UCI and all graduate students, exclusive of the M.D and J.D. programs. In addition, the Graduate Division oversees all post-doctoral training programs and personnel at UCI, exclusive of the medical intern and medical resident programs conducted by the School of Medicine. The Dean of the Graduate Division is responsible for the administration of graduate and post-doctoral study at UCI in accordance with academic policies established by the Academic Senate via the Graduate Council. 
The Graduate Division serves as the campus-wide advocate for the advancement of graduate education and strives for standards of excellence, fairness, and equity in all graduate programs at UCI. To fulfill this mission, the Graduate Division: 
• Facilitates programmatic activities which help develop and promote academic quality through strategic planning, policy development, and effective resource allocation. 
• Articulates the views, needs, and priorities of graduate education within the context of general policy and budget development to ensure that academic goals properly inform campus-wide decision making. 
• Facilitates communication among schools, departments, and administrative offices to ensure that the academic policies established by the Academic Senate’s Graduate Council are implemented through efficient and rational administrative procedures. 
• Protects the general welfare of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in all areas of concern, including, but not limited to, financial support, apprentice personnel conditions, academic progress, intellectual property, equal opportunity, and sexual harassment. 
• Administers appropriate regulatory activities designed to ensure campus-wide and UC system- wide accountability aimed at ensuring academic quality standards and other institutional policies and regulations related to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. 
• Encourages timely completion of graduate degrees by monitoring student degree progress, encouraging faculty advising and mentoring, and ensuring fair and equitable treatment of all students. Provides campus-wide student services that facilitate academic progress, as well as professional development. 
• Enhances access, representation, and the educational experience of underrepresented students in order to achieve the University's diversity objectives. Develops institutional initiatives to enhance the pool of qualified applicants and, by implementing Graduate Council policies, ensures the academic excellence of entering students. 
• Works with the Graduate Council to develop local graduate education policies. Provides information, institutional data, and analysis of issues impacting graduate education to support the Council's policy functions, and recommends new policies. Implements Graduate Council policies and provides outcome assessment and analysis. 
• Works with the Council in evaluating new program initiatives and assessing continuing programs. 
• Provides central administrative services that help sustain and improve the quality of graduate education. 
B. The Role of Graduate Council 
The Graduate Council is a standing committee of the Academic Senate, Irvine Division, charged with reviewing and regulating graduate education within the framework of Academic Senate 
4 
Updated 1/17/19 
regulations. The Graduate Council reviews all proposals for new degree programs and carries out, on behalf of the Academic Senate, mandated periodic reviews of existing graduate programs. Representatives include members of the Academic Senate, the Graduate Dean (ex officio), three graduate students, and a Library representative. There is a monthly meeting schedule during the academic year. One Council member is appointed campus representative to the UC System-wide Academic Senate Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs (CCGA). 
The Graduate Council sets policies and standards for admission to graduate student status; determines eligibility for fellowships and assistantships; establishes policies relating to graduate degrees; approves changes in degree requirements; establishes procedural rules for graduate study; sets policy for satisfactory academic progress, graduate student course loads, transfers of academic credit, part-time study, and leaves of absence. 
C. The Role of the Faculty Graduate Advisor 
The Faculty Graduate Advisor is the official faculty representative of the Graduate Dean in matters affecting graduate students in the Faculty Graduate Advisor's academic unit. A close working relationship is established between the Advisor and the Graduate Division. The Graduate Dean is dependent upon the experience and judgment of Graduate Advisors, and upon their recommendations, in matters requiring the Graduate Dean's action. The Graduate Division staff provides information to the Advisors on a continuing basis and responds to requests for special assistance. 
The Faculty Graduate Advisor is responsible for supervising graduate study in their department and for ensuring that each graduate student is assigned an individual faculty advisor and mentor. In many academic units, the advisor is instrumental in the appointment and supervision of graduate student Teaching Assistants, Associates, Readers, and Tutors. In most schools, there is also an Associate Dean for Graduate Studies who coordinates many of the functions which affect graduate students. This faculty member works in conjunction with their academic dean and department chairs. 
II. ADMISSIONS 
A. Admissions Policy 
1. General Policy 
Admission to graduate study at UCI is by authority and action of the Graduate Dean according to Academic Senate regulations and policies established by the Graduate Council of the University of California, Irvine. The Graduate Dean has delegated authority for direct admission of students to the academic units, except in cases where applicants who do not meet the basic requirements for graduate admission (e.g., unsatisfactory grade point average, bachelor's degree requirements, etc.). Admission to a specific graduate program is made by recommendation of a particular departmental graduate admissions committee, which serves as the agent of the faculty. The chief academic administrator of the department or school may limit the number of admissions for budgetary reasons, and may return to the admissions committee any recommendation that is not consistent with the rules of the faculty. The Graduate Dean authorizes admission actions consistent with Academic Senate regulations and University policy. The staff of the Graduate Division is available for assistance and consultation in the admission process. 
5 
Updated 1/17/19 
The basic requirements for admission are adequate preparation for successful graduate study, and suitability of academic objectives for the specific program. Educational Testing Service's (ETS) Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are required of applicants applying to most graduate programs, with certain exceptions. See individual graduate program requirements for details. In certain biological/medical fields, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores can be substituted for GRE scores with the approval of the Graduate Dean. Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or GRE scores are required for applicants to the Paul Merage School of Business, except for Executive MBA (EMBA) and Health Care MBA (HCEMBA) applicants. A non-refundable application fee is required of all applicants. An application fee waiver may be available to certain domestic applicants. Further information and current fees are available on the Graduate Division website. The academic unit and the Graduate Division evaluate applications for admission with specific assessment of official transcripts of previous academic work, letters of recommendation, the results of the GRE or GMAT tests, and the applicant's "Statement of Purpose". Individual graduate programs may require other materials such as examples of previous work. 
The other major factors considered by the departmental graduate admissions committee are the applicant's: (1) previous academic performance at an institution with degree standards equivalent to those of the University of California; (2) academic preparation for the graduate curriculum; (3) intellectual capacity; (4) motivation and maturity; and (5) specific areas of academic interest. An applicant may be denied admission because of a lack of strength in any of the first four areas, or because the program does not match the applicant's interests in terms of focus and/or academic resources. Please note that the requirements listed in this document (e.g., at least a 3.0 undergraduate GPA for graduate admission) are minimum standards, and individual programs have the prerogative to apply more stringent requirements. 
A 3.0 grade point average is the minimum requirement for admission to graduate study, but a lower GPA may be accepted by exception when balanced by other positive indicators of potential. Even a recognized bachelor's degree is not an absolute requirement. As an exception, students of unusual intellectual achievement may be admitted without having earned an undergraduate degree (see Section A. 2. Exceptional Admissions below). 
The number of applicants each year who meet the minimal requirements for admission is substantially larger than the number that can be supported by the available university resources. A fundamental principle is that University of California graduate programs are not required to accept all applicants who meet a minimum standard, nor must they fill the available spaces on a first-come, first-served basis. The objective of each departmental graduate admissions committee is to admit the applicants who are best qualified and whose interests and expertise best match that of the academic program. 
2. Exceptional Admissions 
All exceptional admissions must be reviewed by the Graduate Dean before admission is granted. Exceptional admissions are required for: low undergraduate GPA (even for students with graduate degrees); lack of a U.S. bachelor's degree equivalent, and/or lack of official transcripts verifying the award of the degree; lack of Graduate Record Examination (GRE), or GRE score older than five years; lack of Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) scores, if required; lack of Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) scores; low TOEFL or IELTS scores; or TOEFL or IELTS scores more than two years old for students whose primary language is not English. 6 
Updated 1/17/19 
For exceptional admissions, the exception form with justification for exceptional admission, as well as the Admissions Committee Recommendation (ACR) form should be completed and forwarded to the Graduate Division, along with supporting documents. Following review by the Graduate Dean, the department will be notified of the Graduate Dean's decision. The letter of admission (or denial) will then be sent to the applicant by the department or school to which the applicant applied. 
3. Waiver of Standard Graduate Admission Requirements 
a. Low Grade Point Average 
Infrequently, recommendations are received from academic units to admit someone with a grade point average below the required 3.0. It is possible to admit an applicant with a low grade point average who may appear to be highly qualified based upon recent GRE or GMAT standardized scores and/or research or professional experience. A request for an exception to the minimum GPA of 3.0 must be made in writing from the program to the Graduate Dean. The individual may be admitted only with approval of the Graduate Dean. 
b. The Bachelor's Degree 
On extremely rare occasions, recommendations are received from academic units to admit someone who does not have a Bachelor’s degree or its equivalent. It is possible to admit a very highly qualified person to graduate standing by waiving this established requirement provided the following criteria are satisfied: 
1) Inappropriateness of requiring the applicant to complete an undergraduate program because of: unusual intellectual maturity; conflicting responsibilities which would unreasonably extend the amount of time required; and a significant level of achievement in a specialization related to the graduate program of interest. 
2) Demonstrated ability to do graduate level work, as evidenced by: GRE or similar test scores; published papers or other examples of work in a related area; adequate preparation in foundation areas; and letters of recommendation. 
3) Evidence of having attained a depth and breadth of intellectual development equivalent to an undergraduate education, including a specialization comparable to an undergraduate academic major. This should be determined by such means as are deemed academically appropriate by the Graduate Dean. It might include a review of the applicant's related work and evaluation of any teaching or research experience by an ad hoc advisory committee composed of regular faculty members. Waiver of the bachelor's degree requirement must be approved in advance and in writing by the Graduate Dean before admission. Exceptions must be reported to the Graduate Council. 
c. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) 
The GRE (or GMAT for applicants to MBA programs) administered by the Educational Testing Service, (ETS), is required as part of the formal application for admission to graduate study. While there is no minimum score requirement, fellowships are rarely awarded in the absence of a complete application file, including GRE scores. Scores for tests taken five or more years previously can be used only if approved by the Graduate Dean. 
7 
Updated 1/17/19 
Departmental graduate admission committees are urged to consider GRE/GMAT scores only as appropriate and relevant to the particular field of study and only as one of a number of indicators of potential for success in graduate study. Where English is not the primary language of the applicant, TOEFL or IELTS scores may provide supplementary information. Alternative GRE/GMAT tests, and testing situations, are provided by the Educational Testing Service for applicants with disabilities or health-related needs on request. It is possible, given other indicators of potential for success in graduate study, to formally admit an applicant with the provision that GRE/GMAT scores are submitted prior to matriculation or within the first quarter after registration. 
For those applicants seeking admission to the School of Business’s M.B.A. programs who have completed graduate medical degree programs from accredited U.S. educational institutions, the GMAT requirements may be waived. Applicants who meet the criteria above, and have been awarded degrees of M.D., D.O., D.P.M., D.D.S., or D.D.M., will not be required to take the GMAT to qualify for admission to the M.B.A. programs. For currently enrolled M.D. students interested in applying to the M.D./M.B.A. Joint Degree Program, the MCAT, along with the completion of three years of medical school training in good standing and passage of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step I, currently serve as a waiver for the GMAT entrance examination usually required for application to the M.B.A. program. 
On rare occasions, it is possible to waive the GRE/GMAT requirement, provided that substantial evidence of achievement in graduate work in a recognized academic institution can be provided. The criterion applied in such cases is either: 
l) Completion of at least two full years of post-baccalaureate coursework exclusive of credit for thesis or independent research, with superior scholarship; or 2) prior formal advancement to candidacy for a Ph.D. Requests for these exceptions must be submitted in writing to the Graduate Division. 
d. Demonstration of English Language Proficiency 
Applicants whose primary language is not English are required to submit TOEFL or IELTS scores for admission consideration. U.S citizens are waived from this requirement. The TOEFL or IELTS requirement is also waived automatically for applicants who have completed all the requirements for their high school diploma, bachelor’s degree, or an advanced degree in a country where the primary and/or dominant language is English and this was the language of instruction of the school where the requirements were completed. A list of these countries is available on the Graduate Division website. 
4. Second Advanced Degrees 
The University of California generally discourages the duplication of advanced degrees. At the same time, it recognizes that a professional degree does not duplicate an academic degree, and that the holders of either an academic or professional degree may have the pressing need to earn another degree in an area different from that of their first academic endeavors. 
The Graduate Dean has delegated the authority to admit students for a second Master's degree in an unrelated discipline to the academic units. If a program wishes to admit a student for a second Master’s degree in the same discipline or a related field, the program must request an exception. These requests must be made in writing to the Graduate Dean and should include strong justification for admitting the applicant for a second Master’s degree in the same 
8 
Updated 1/17/19 
discipline or a related field, as well as a statement assuring the Dean that there will be no duplication, transfer, or waiving of coursework. 
[Example: If a student with an MS in Civil Engineering applied to UCI for an MS in Environmental Engineering, it would require an exception to admit them. However, if the same student with an MS in Civil Engineering applied to UCI for an MA in History, this would not require an exception.] 
Admission for a second Ph.D. is only by exception to policy and must be approved by the Graduate Dean; however, such requests are rarely granted. All requests must be made in writing to the Graduate Dean and should include strong justification for admitting the applicant for a second Ph.D. It must also be accompanied by a statement assuring the Graduate Dean that the applicant's first Ph.D. is in an unrelated area, and that there will be no duplication, transfer, or waiving of coursework. 
5. Non-degree Graduate Admission 
Although students are ordinarily admitted to a UC graduate school only for the purpose of study leading to an advanced degree, international Education Abroad Program (EAP) students are an exception to this rule. These are non-degree seeking students who attend UCI for one to three quarters of study. 
B. The Application Process 
1. Requirements for All Applicants 
a. Application Fees 
A non-refundable application fee is required for all applicants. Applications cannot be processed until the application fee has been received. The application fee is devoted to the administrative cost of processing all applications received, and is non-refundable under any circumstances. 
1) U.S. Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents of the U.S. 
A non-refundable application fee may be paid by MasterCard or Visa credit card, check or money order. The check or money order should be made payable to "UC-Regents" and submitted with the application fee form to the Graduate Division. The applicant's name and application number should be printed on the check or money order. 
The application fee may be waived for certain applicants in this category. Check the Graduate Division website for details. 
2) All other Applicants 
The application fee may be paid by MasterCard or Visa credit card. Due to the difficulties involved in handling foreign checks, the UCI Cashier's Office will only accept international money orders or international bank drafts in U.S. dollars drawn on a U.S. bank. Please note that all international drafts must have the name, address and complete AB routing numbers of the U.S. bank imprinted on the draft. 
9 
Updated 1/17/19 
Cash cannot be accepted. 
Mail application fee forms and check or money order as described above to: Graduate Division 120 Aldrich Hall University of California Irvine, CA 92697-3180 
b. Transcripts 
One official transcript of all previous post-secondary academic work must be submitted. Some programs require a second transcript. Please check with your program prior to submission. Transcripts should be sent directly to the UCI academic department by the Registrar of the issuing institution. When students have final work in progress at the time of the first application, a final official transcript covering that work and certifying the award of any degree must be received before the student is officially enrolled. In such situations, the student is admitted provisionally, pending receipt of official transcripts reflecting award of the bachelor's degree. 
c. Graduate Record Examination Scores 
GRE scores are required for admission to graduate study at UCI, except for applicants for the M.F.A., Master’s in Nursing Science, teaching credential and MBA programs. GMAT scores are required for applicants to the School of Business, except for applicants to the Executive MBA (EMBA) and Health Care Executive MBA (HCEMBA) program. In addition, some graduate programs require GRE Subject Test scores in the area of specialization. The applicant must request that the Educational Testing Service (ETS) report scores directly to the UCI Graduate Division, institutional code number 4859. The applicant does not need to indicate a department when making the request with ETS. Test scores that are more than five years old may be accepted only if approved by the Graduate Dean. 
d. Letters of Recommendation (LOR) 
Three letters of recommendation, preferably from professors or instructors in the proposed field of study, are required. As a result of federal and state legislation, letters of recommendation are open to inspection by the applicant, unless a voluntary statement waiving the applicant's right of access to the letter of recommendation is submitted with the letter. The waiver statement must be on a separate document: no statement about confidentiality can appear on a letter itself, which is used by a departmental graduate admissions committee. The LOR and waiver process is normally via the online application system; paper LORs are accepted, as well, and forms for this purpose are available on the Graduate Division website. 
e. Statement of Purpose 
The Statement of Purpose provides important guidance to the departmental graduate admissions committee in their decision-making process. It is important for assessing whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasonably be satisfied in the graduate program to which admission is sought. 
f. Individual Program Requirements 
10 
Updated 1/17/19 
Individual program requirements must be consistently applied to all applicants to a single program, but may vary from program to program. Typical individual program requirements include, but are not limited to, samples of previous academic work, writing samples, statements about research experience or foreign language competence, and portfolios of artistic or creative endeavors. 
2. Special Requirements for International Applicants 
a. Application 
Applicants who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. are subject to all standard UCI admission requirements. In addition, they must provide satisfactory evidence of English language proficiency to complete their application, and evidence of financial support in order to obtain the necessary visa document, e.g. the I-20 form for the F-1 student visa or DS-2019 form for the J-1 student visa. Note that this visa document is issued by the International Center at UCI. The International Center requires completion of the I‐20/DS‐2019 Request for New Graduate Students. This form allows UC Irvine to issue an I‐20/DS‐2019 for students to apply for an F‐1 or J‐1 student visa. This form should be sent to a student’s admitting academic department. 
Special care should be exercised when admitting international students. It is unfair to the applicant to recommend admission in the absence of clear evidence that there are sufficient English language skills and financial resources, as well as background in the discipline, to ensure success in the graduate program. Many students underestimate both the time and the financial resources required for completion of a graduate degree at UCI. Some international applicants may also misinterpret encouraging communication as a firm contract with regard to admission and/or financial support. 
International applicants are urged to apply at least four months prior to the stated application deadline dates, or as early as possible after the online application is available. Graduates of recognized academic institutions outside the U.S. ordinarily should have completed degree programs representing a minimum of 16 years of schooling with at least 12 years at the elementary and secondary school level. Applicants holding only professional diplomas or higher certificates in accounting, business, physical education, or health education from universities or technical and vocational schools should not apply. Members of professional associations, such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants, are not qualified for graduate standing unless they also hold recognized university-level degrees or titles. 
b. Evaluation of International Credentials 
The international applicant is expected to have completed the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's degree with a satisfactory level of scholarship. Academic units are responsible for this assessment. The Graduate Division provides training to academic unit staff on determining equivalency of foreign credentials and offers support in the foreign credential evaluation process during the admissions cycle. Upon request by the academic unit, the Graduate Division can provide an additional review of international transcripts and other credentials, and provide a supplemental evaluation which states equivalency to U.S. degrees and measures of academic standing according to established guidelines for the particular international educational system. For purposes of campus admissions requirements, academic units need only determine that an applicant has the equivalent of a 3.0 GPA and it is not necessary for academic units to determine an exact U.S. GPA equivalent unless the applicant does not meet the 3.0 threshold. This 
11 
Updated 1/17/19 
evaluation can be provided only in relation to formal applicants for graduate study at UCI, and only on the basis of official credentials provided as part of a formal application. 
Only general information about bachelor's degree equivalency can be provided to a prospective applicant prior to application; for specific credential evaluation prior to application, inquiries may be referred to independent professional agencies that provide this service for a fee. Such evaluations are advisory only, and may not be accepted as the sole basis of admission actions. 
c. Foreign Academic Records 
One set of official records from foreign institutions should be sent directly to the UCI academic unit to which the applicant is applying. All applicants are required to submit official records from each academic institution attended after secondary school. Official records are original documents, issued by the institution, which bear the actual signature of the registrar and the seal of the issuing academic institution. True copies, facsimiles, or photocopies will be accepted only if the photocopies themselves have been personally signed by an academic or public official who has certified that they are exact copies of the original documents. Each certified copy must also bear the seal and title of the authorizing official. Uncertified photocopies are not acceptable. American embassies or consulates are not authorized to certify academic records. 
d. Required Records 
Unless academic records and diplomas are issued in English by the institution, the official records in their original language must be submitted with an authorized, complete, and exact English translation. All official academic records must show the dates of applicant's enrollment; all subject or course units, credits, or hours; and grades in each subject. If rank is determined by the results of comprehensive examinations, records should show the examination date and applicant's scores, rank, class, and division. All records must include a complete description of institutional grading scales or other standards of evaluation with minimum and maximum grades/marks indicated. The applicant must also submit official evidence of the conferral of all degrees, diplomas, or professional titles and the date of the formal conferral (month and year). These certificates should indicate the exact name of the degree, diploma, or title as it is known in the country of origin and not in American terms. If the applicant is applying prior to the end of the applicant's final year of study, a supplementary record showing completion of all remaining coursework and evidence of the award of the degree must be sent as soon as it is available. If applicant has also attended a university in either Canada or the U.S., including any campus of the University of California including the Irvine campus, the applicant must have the registrar of each institution send an official transcript. Records submitted to UCI will not be copied, returned to the applicant, or sent elsewhere. 
e. English Language Proficiency 
1) Demonstration of English Language Proficiency for Admission: 
Applicants whose primary language is not English are required to demonstrate proficiency in English for admission consideration. However, this requirement will be waived automatically for American citizens and applicants who have completed all the requirements for their high school diploma, Bachelor’s degree, or an advanced degree in a country where the primary and/or dominant language is English and English was the language of instruction of the school where the requirements were completed. Proficiency in English must be demonstrated by attaining the minimum required score (indicated below) for either of two standardized, internationally 
12 
Updated 1/17/19 
administered tests: TOEFL (the Test of English as a Foreign Language); or IELTS (International English Language Testing System). The applicant should take one of these tests at the earliest available date to ensure that the scores are reported in time to meet application deadlines. 
TOEFL The TOEFL is administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). TOEFL Score Requirements for Admission Consideration: 
• For the paper-based test, a minimum score of 550 
• For the internet based Test (TOEFL iBT), a minimum score of 80 
• Individual schools and programs may have more strict language proficiency requirements. 
• Please see the Paul Merage School of Business website for program-specific language proficiency requirements. 
TOEFL iBT (internet Based Testing) The TOEFL iBT, administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), is the next generation of the TOEFL exam. The test includes a speaking component. TOEFL iBT Score Requirements for Admission Consideration: 
• An overall minimum score of 80 for admission. 
TOEFL and TOEFL iBT scores that are more than two years old are not acceptable. Results of institutional (non-ETS) administrations of the TOEFL or TOEFL iBT are not acceptable. 
IELTS English language proficiency may also be demonstrated by passing the Academic Modules of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam. 
IELTS Score Requirements for Admission Consideration: 
• An overall minimum score of 7 for admission, with a score of no less than 6 on any individual module. 
IELTS test scores that are more than two years old are not acceptable. 
2) Demonstration of English Language Proficiency for Teaching Assistant/Associate 
Employment: 
International and U.S. Permanent Resident graduate students who are not citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council, and who wish to be considered for appointment as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate, must pass an approved oral English proficiency examination. There is no exception to this requirement. Oral English proficiency may be demonstrated by achieving a score of at least: 
▪ 26 on the Speaking component of the TOEFL iBT; 
▪ 8 on the Speaking component of the Academic Modules of the IELTS. 
▪ 50 on the SPEAK Test (administered by UCI) 
▪ 5 on the TOEP Test (administered by UCI) 
Note: The SPEAK and TOEP tests can only be taken after admission to UCI. 
13 
Updated 1/17/19 
For more information regarding oral English proficiency requirements for the purpose of graduate student employment, see Section IV. Academic Appointments and Graduate Student Employment. 
f. Verification of Financial Resources 
International applicants are required to certify that they possess sufficient funds to cover all fees, transportation, and living expenses for the first year of their studies at UCI. Students who have been admitted for graduate studies at UCI must complete the I‐20/DS‐2019 Request for New Graduate Students and submit it to the admitting academic department if the student requires an F-1/J-1 student visa. Upon completion of these forms, and thorough review by the admitting department, paperwork is submitted to the International Center for review and document issuance. This process takes 15 business days; incomplete information may require longer processing times. International applicants who have deferred admission must submit updated documents and forms and an updated financial verification statement before visa documents can be issued. All inquiries regarding verification of financial support or visa documents should be directed to the International Center. 
3. Application Deadlines 
Each academic program has its own deadlines; some are as early as December 1, while others may accept applications until March 1 or thereafter. Many programs have earlier deadlines for students interested in financial support. Potential students are advised to consult with the academic unit of interest to determine their deadline.

C. Admission Decisions 
1. General Policy 
A major responsibility of the Graduate Dean, in cooperation with the Graduate Advisors and the Departmental Graduate Admissions Committees of the individual graduate programs, is to ensure that each applicant receives fair, reasonable, and timely consideration in the admissions process. When a graduate program admits an applicant, a binding contract has been entered into by the University. The utmost care should be taken that such actions are appropriate and in accordance with campus policy. Graduate Division staff reviews all admission actions on behalf of the Graduate Dean. Programs will be notified immediately when it is determined that such actions do not follow required procedures. 
2. The Admissions Committee Recommendation (ACR) 
When a decision has been reached to admit an applicant and the applicant has been notified, the ACR form should be carefully completed and promptly forwarded to the Graduate Division with a copy of the admission letter, letters of recommendation, and an official transcript(s). The ACR form is available at the Graduate Division forms page. As ACR packets are received by the Graduate Division, the Admissions staff will review ACRs to confirm admissibility. Once confirmed, the applicant will officially be admitted, at which time the applicant will receive a congratulatory e-mail with a link to complete the Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) and other pertinent information. 
Admission by exception is made by the Graduate Dean. The letter of admission may be sent by the department to the applicant only after notification of the Graduate Dean's approval. The Exception Request Form, including a justification for the exception, is submitted to the Graduate Dean along with the entire ACR packet. This information will be used by the Graduate Dean in reviewing the recommendation, and must be completed for applicants with an undergraduate GPA below 3.0, or where other exceptional circumstances apply. 
It is important that a decision is made on each application and communicated to the applicant within a reasonable period of time, but at least 30 days before the beginning of the quarter to which admission is requested. The experience of most graduate programs indicates that early offers of admission result in success in the competition for outstanding applicants. 
15 
Updated 1/17/19 
While only the Graduate Division can officially admit an applicant, the academic units should take action on all other open files by coding them as Denied (D), Incomplete (I) or Withdrawn (W). All applicants whose application was denied should be notified in writing by the department. 
3. Provisional Admission 
An applicant may be admitted provisionally, pending receipt of items such as final transcript showing awarding of a bachelor's degree and/or official GRE scores, or other requirements. However, applicants may not be admitted provisionally pending receipt of TOEFL scores unless an unofficial score has been submitted. While students will be allowed to enroll provisionally, all provisions of admission must be satisfied within the first 4 weeks of the second quarter of enrollment. Academic holds are placed on a student’s enrollment if the provision is not satisfied and the student may be prevented from enrolling in a subsequent quarter. 
4. Conditions of Admission 
The graduate program may attach specific conditions to admission, such as the satisfaction of certain coursework requirements during the first academic year. Students may not be admitted with the condition that they obtain a particular score on the GRE or GMAT examination. It is the graduate program's responsibility to notify the student of conditions at the time of admission. A copy of the written notice should be sent to the Graduate Division. Conditions attached to admission should not be construed as probation; i.e., graduate students are not admitted "on probation". 
5. Denials 
a. Notice of Denial 
If the academic program denies admission to an applicant, a denial notice should be sent to the unsuccessful applicant as soon as possible after a decision is made. The department should code the application as D (Denied) in the system. 
b. Denial - Application Incomplete 
Where there is not sufficient information for action by the Departmental Graduate Admissions Committee in time to allow admission for the specific requested quarter, the academic department should code the application I (Incomplete). 
c. Appeal of Admissions Decision 
To learn more about the factors that led to the decision to deny admission, the applicant should contact the specific graduate program. An applicant who then wishes to appeal the decision should contact the Graduate Dean; the Dean has final authority to decide admissions appeals. In cooperation with the academic unit, any complaint that due process was not accorded, or that the result was in some way affected by illegal bias, will be carefully investigated. In most instances, the graduate program is asked to review the earlier recommendation of their Departmental Graduate Admissions Committee. Whether or not the earlier recommendation is changed to favor admission of the applicant, the result is communicated to the applicant via letter sent by the academic program. 
16 
Updated 1/17/19 
6. Deferral of Admission/Postponement of Matriculation 
When an applicant has been admitted to pursue graduate study at UCI, a request for deferral of admission is considered a request for admission to a later quarter. The request for deferral must be made in writing to the academic program and will be reviewed by the Graduate Advisor or Graduate Admission Committee Chair. Deferrals may be granted for a maximum of three quarters following the original quarter of admission at the discretion of the academic program. The deadline for requesting a deferral of admission is the end of the second week of classes in the quarter of initial admission. Deferral letters will be sent to applicants by the academic unit. 
D. Readmission 
A student who has previously withdrawn from UCI, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission by submitting a new Application for Graduate Study. Readmission is not guaranteed. 
Payment of the non-refundable Application Fee is required. A new statement of purpose and transcripts of any additional academic work completed since first admitted to UCI must be submitted, and submission of new letters of recommendation is advised. 
All applications for readmission are subject to the same careful review as those of new applicants. If readmitted, a student's previous academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the program Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including course requirements and formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student will be expected to complete at least one additional academic quarter in residence before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the second quarter following readmission. Prior to formal readmission, the applicant should be advised in detail about the requirements which must be satisfied for completion of the advanced degree, and in most cases, a timetable for completion should be established. The Graduate Division should be consulted if there is any doubt about the requirements. A copy of the letter conveying the correct and complete advice to the applicant for readmission should be sent to the Graduate Division with the ACR. 
III. FELLOWSHIPS AND GRANTS 
A. Graduate Student Support at UCI 
Financial support is available to most graduate students at UCI. Types of support include, but are not limited to, fee fellowships, nonresident supplemental tuition fellowships , stipend support, student loans, grants-in-aid, merit-based fellowships, diversity fellowships, and academic student employment performing teaching and/or research assistance. This section will discuss the various fellowship opportunities afforded to UCI graduate students. For information concerning employment, please refer to Section IV on Academic Appointments and Graduate Student Employment. 
B. Fellowships 
1. Types of Block Allocation Fellowship Support 
UCI's fellowship funds are administered by the Graduate Division in close cooperation with the academic units. The Graduate Dean makes annual block allocations of fellowship funds to the 
17 
Updated 1/17/19 
academic units, via the respective academic dean; funds are then distributed to the academic units who have discretion over awarding fellowships to their graduate students. Fellowship awards may be in the form of payment of fees/tuition and/or nonresident supplemental tuition, and/or a stipend. 
a. Fee/Tuition Fellowships 
Fee/tuition fellowships pay all or a part of a student’s assessed fees/tuition, exclusive of nonresident supplemental tuition. 
b. Nonresident Supplemental Tuition (NRST) Fellowships 
1) Ph.D. students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States may be awarded nonresident supplemental tuition fellowship support on the basis of outstanding scholarship for a maximum of one year (three quarters). Students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States are expected to establish California residency prior to their second year of study. 
2) International Ph.D. students who have demonstrated outstanding scholarship and academic progress may receive nonresident supplemental tuition fellowship support. Following advancement to candidacy, international doctoral students will not be assessed NRST for a period of up to three consecutive calendar years. Any such student who continues to be enrolled or who re-enrolls after three years will be charged the full NRST that is in effect at that time. Quarters on Leave of Absence or Filing Fee count toward the allowable three calendar years 
c. Stipend Fellowships 
Stipends may be provided in any amount; it is suggested that stipends should be at least equivalent to the salary a student would earn as a TA or GSR/GSAR if the student will not be receiving support via employment. 
d. Dissertation Fellowships 
Dissertation Fellowships provide support to outstanding continuing graduate students in order to facilitate timely completion of a high quality dissertation. Awards are made directly by the academic unit or by the Graduate Dean. These awards are intended to relieve the Fellow from service obligations for full-time attention to dissertation completion; therefore employment may be either limited or prohibited while receiving a dissertation fellowship. Awards may be for one quarter, two quarters, or three quarters and are not renewable past one year. 
1) Dissertation fellowship stipends should be at least equivalent to the salary a student would 
earn as a TA or GSR/GSAR; in addition, these fellowships will cover regular student fee/tuition costs, exclusive of nonresident supplemental tuition. 
2) Dissertation fellows may not hold any employment appointment during the fellowship 
period, depending on the restrictions of the award. 
3) Nominees must already have formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. Successful 
completion of the Ph.D. is expected no later than three quarters after the fellowship tenure; 
18 
Updated 1/17/19 
certain dissertation fellowships may require completion within one quarter after the fellowship award period. 
2. Special Fellowships 
The Graduate Division offers a number of different fellowships that are merit-based and are generally for continuing graduate students with special qualifications. Funding is provided through internal Graduate Division resources or endowments and is awarded via a competitive process to students who meet specific criteria for the respective award. Awards normally pay all or part of student fees/tuition, and/or a stipend. Awards in these categories may in some cases be in addition to departmental support. A list of these fellowships is found on the Graduate Division website. Nomination/application instructions and eligibility criteria vary. 
3. Extramural Fellowship Information and Advising 
The Graduate Division receives information about extramural fellowship and grant opportunities, and provides assistance to students who wish to apply for support from federal agencies, foundations, and other non-University sources. From time to time special notices of fellowship competitions administered by the Graduate Division will be distributed via e-mail. Each year, the Graduate Division offers workshops for graduate students interested in various extramural fellowship programs. Visit the Graduate Division website for more information. 
The Graduate Division also subscribes to an electronic grant database: Pivot. Pivot combines the most comprehensive, editorially maintained database of funding opportunities worth an estimated $44 billion with a unique database of 3 million pre-populated scholar profiles. Information on extramural awards is available on the Graduate Division website. 
C. Pre-Doctoral Fellowship Policies 
This section describes campus policies and procedures related to graduate student fellowships or scholarship awards that are administered by the University. These may include both University (intramural) and extramural fellowships depending upon the type of award. 
1. Definition of Intramural Fellowship 
An intramural fellowship is defined as a University funded award that is offered to a graduate student formally admitted for graduate study in a Doctoral or Master's program. University funded fellowships or scholarships are awarded primarily on the basis of outstanding scholarly achievement and promise. Awards are offered by the academic units to enable graduate students to pursue study leading to an advanced degree without requiring any service obligations. Fellowships are not to be used in lieu of employment compensation for services performed by the student to the University. An intramural fellowship award may include a stipend, student fees/tuition, summer research support, payment of nonresident supplemental tuition, or a combination thereof. Additional support may be provided to a student through on-campus employment offered by the department or via extramural support. (See Section IV, Academic Appointments and Graduate Student Employment.) 
2. Definition of Extramural Fellowship 
An extramural fellowship is defined as an award that is funded by sources external to the university and intended to financially support a graduate student formally admitted for graduate 
19 
Updated 1/17/19 
study in a Doctoral or Master's program. Extramurally funded fellowships, grants, or scholarships are awarded primarily on the basis of outstanding scholarly achievement and promise. Awards are typically funded by federal or state agencies, benefactors of UCI, or other entities separate from UCI. Institutional awards, commonly in the form of federal grants, are awarded to a specific academic unit for student support. Traineeship appointments and fellowship recipients are decided at the academic unit level. Examples are the Department of Education GAANN, NIH/PHS training grants and NSF Research Traineeships. 
UCI serves in a custodial role and usually administers the funding including payment to the student. An extramural award may include a stipend, student fees/tuition, summer research support, payment of nonresident supplemental tuition, or a combination thereof. If consistent with the external agency's guidelines, additional support may be provided by the student's department via intramural or university fellowship or employment. 
3. Responsibility 
Campus policies and procedures related to University administered fellowships or scholarships are under the jurisdiction of the Graduate Council and the Graduate Dean. Nominees for these awards are evaluated on the basis of criteria established by the Graduate Council in consultation with the Graduate Dean. Individual academic units are authorized to make awards directly to students from their annual block fellowship allocation and other sources. However, final responsibility for University administered fellowships (intramural and extramural) and for the establishment and monitoring of policies and procedures related to their administration rests with the Graduate Division. 
4. Criteria for Awards 
a. Admission to Graduate Study 
Fellowship nominations and award letters for students applying for graduate admission must be preceded by formal admission by the academic program and the Graduate Division. Under certain conditions, the admission letter may contain a fellowship offer. The student's academic unit can provide further information. 
b. Full Time Graduate Student Status 
Award recipients must register (enroll and pay fees/tuition) at UCI by the established deadline each academic quarter, and devote full time (12 quarter units) to graduate study and/or research in the field for which the award is made. Fellowship support will not be given to students with part-time status. 
c. Leave of Absence 
A graduate student may not retain a fellowship while on leave of absence. Deferment of fellowship offers to a different quarter than that quarter originally offered may not be allowed. 
d. Non-degree or Filing Fee Status 
Graduate students in non-degree status are not eligible for fellowship support. Similarly, graduate students may not receive fellowship support while on Filing Fee status. 
20 
Updated 1/17/19 
5. Responsibility of Successful Nominees 
Newly entering students who receive an award must: 
a. Accept or decline the award offer by April 15 in accordance with CGS guidelines (see 6 
below) or notify their academic unit if they cannot meet this deadline. 
Both newly entering and continuing students who receive an award must: 
b. Students who are U.S. citizens or U.S. Permanent Residents must submit a Free Application 
for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to the designated processor (as indicated in the application) whether or not they believe they qualify. 
c. Students who are non-U.S. citizens are required to complete and submit tax-related 
information via the GLACIER System. 
d. Register at UCI each quarter and devote full-time (12 quarter units) to graduate study and/or 
research during the tenure of the award; and 
e. Earn a letter grade of B, S, or above in all courses completed during each of the three most 
recent quarters of enrollment. 
f. Earn no more than two Incomplete (I) grades during each of the three most recent quarters of 
enrollment. 
g. Earn a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher during each of the three most recent quarters of 
enrollment. 
h. Make satisfactory academic progress toward the degree objective. 
6. Council of Graduate Schools in the United States Resolution 
As a member of the Council of Graduate Schools in the United States, UCI subscribes to the Council's resolution concerning graduate fellowships which states: 
"Acceptance of an offer of financial support* (such as a graduate scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, or assistantship) for the next academic year by a prospective or enrolled graduate student completes an agreement that both student and graduate school expect to honor. In that context, the conditions affecting such offers and their acceptance must be defined carefully and understood by all parties. Students are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15; earlier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. In those instances in which a student accepts an offer before April 15, and subsequently desires to withdraw that acceptance, the student may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after April 15 commits the student not to accept another offer without first obtaining a written release from the institution to which a commitment has been made. Similarly, an offer by an institution after April 15 is conditional on presentation by the student of the written release from any previously accepted offer. It is further agreed by the institutions and organizations subscribing to the above Resolution that a copy of this Resolution or a link to the URL should accompany every scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, and assistantship offer." 
21 
Updated 1/17/19 
*This Resolution applies to offers of financial support only, not offers of admission. 
7. Conditions of Awards 
a. Limitation of Fellowship Stipends 
The Graduate Dean, in consultation with the Graduate Council and the student's home department, determines the appropriate level of intramural fellowship stipends to be awarded from University fellowship funds. 
b. Supplementation Policy 
With prior approval of the Graduate Dean, graduate student fellowships or traineeship stipends administered by the University may be supplemented subject to the following provisions: 
1) Continued full-time satisfactory progress toward the degree objective is required. Any 
traineeship must be related to the student's academic program. 
2) All limitations, rules, and stipulations of the particular fellowship or traineeship by the 
outside agency or sponsor must be honored. 
3) If employment is in applicable teaching title codes, any appointment is subject to the 
terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement between the University of California and the UAW. 
4) Students receiving Dissertation Fellowships and some Diversity Fellowships are subject 
to limitations or prohibition on employment. Any such restrictions will be noted in the award letter terms and conditions. 
5) For students eligible for both a University funded fellowship and an extramural 
fellowship, the University funded portion of the award will be limited to an amount which, together with the extramural award, brings the total amount to the maximum University funded fellowship award. If the extramural award provides for payment of fees and/or tuition, the extramural award takes precedence over University funded fellowships and remission for those expenses. 
6) There is no specified limitation on extramural fellowship awards. The Graduate Dean will review the level of extramural fellowships awarded and consult with the Graduate Council in those cases where the award may appear excessive. 
7) However, limitations on accepting employment or other support while receiving support 
from an extramural fellowship award may exist. Please refer to the respective extramural award conditions and guidelines. 
D. Research Support 
In evaluating research support vis-à-vis fellowship support, note that campus policy requires the remission of all fees/tuition and nonresident supplemental tuition, if applicable, for GSRs/GSARs appointed at least 25% time for the entire quarter. Remission expenses are to be debited to the salary funding source. Under most circumstances, fellowships may not be used to pay fees and/or tuition 
22 
Updated 1/17/19 
when a remission-eligible appointment exists. See Section IV.B.3. GSR and GSAR Appointment Benefits. 
IV. ACADEMIC APPOINTMENTS AND GRADUATE STUDENT EMPLOYMENT 
A. Graduate Student Teaching Appointments 
(Teaching Assistant, Teaching Associate [Associate In], Reader, and Tutor) 
Experience as a teaching assistant is considered an important component of the graduate educational experience. Many graduate programs require students to serve as teaching assistants, and almost all programs expect graduate students to serve in a teaching capacity sometime during the course of their graduate programs. 
The primary teaching responsibility of the University of California is vested in the faculty. Graduate student teaching responsibilities generally include assistance in such activities as classroom/laboratory teaching, leading discussion groups, office hours, conferences with students, preparation of materials for instruction, proctoring examinations, and correcting student papers and examinations. Academic appointment criteria for graduate students, as stated in this guide, are minimum University standards and requirements. Individual academic unit faculty retain the prerogative to apply stricter standards for teaching appointments within their academic unit. 
NOTE: UCI Academic Student Employees (ASEs) appointed as Teaching Assistants, Teaching Associates (Associate Ins), Readers, and Tutors are covered by a collective bargaining agreement between the Regents of the University of California and the Student Workers Union, International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW). 
Academic Student Employee Titles (ASEs) 
A. Teaching Assistant An academically qualified and registered graduate student in full-time residence chosen for excellent scholarship and for promise as a teacher, who is assigned to assist in the delivery of instruction under the active supervision of a faculty member. A majority of graduate students who perform instructional functions are assigned to the Teaching Assistant title. 
Responsibilities 
• Assist the supervising faculty member by conducting discussion, laboratory or quiz sections that supplement faculty lectures 
• Grading assignments or examinations 
• May provide input into the development of assignments or exams, and hold office hours 
The final responsibility for the content of the course rests with the supervising faculty member. A Teaching Assistant is not independently responsible for the instructional content of a course, selection of assignments, planning, examinations, and determination of student grades or decisions on grade appeals; and is not assigned full instructional responsibility for an entire course. 
B. Teaching Associate (Associate In) An academically qualified and registered graduate student in full-time residence employed temporarily to teach a lower-division course. On an exception basis, a graduate student, upon recommendation from the department head, may be assigned an upper-division course or course section (non-graduate level course only) with the written approval of the Graduate Dean and the UCI 
23 
Updated 1/17/19 
Academic Senate’s Subcommittee on Courses. Such approval must be obtained in writing prior to the student beginning their assignment/appointment. 
Responsibilities 
• Assist in the instruction of any lower-division course or 
• May be assigned to conduct the entire instruction of a lower-division course 
All instructional activities of graduate student Teaching Associates are to be supervised by a faculty member. A Teaching Associate with extensive teaching experience may be presumed to require less direct supervision. During the academic year, a Teaching Associate may not be assigned responsibility as the Instructor of Record. 
C. Reader An academically qualified and registered graduate student (or qualified undergraduate student may be employed when graduate students are not available) employed as a course assistant. A Reader will not be given the responsibilities customarily assigned to Teaching Assistants. 
Responsibilities 
• Grading of homework, papers, laboratory reports, or examinations and 
• Holding of office hours to respond to students’ questions about such assignments 
D. Tutor An academically qualified and registered graduate or undergraduate student who provides tutoring to individuals (one-on-one) or small groups of students. 
Responsibilities 
• Facilitate independent learning and 
• Assist students in understanding course materials. 
B. Graduate Student Researcher Appointments (GSR and GSAR) 
Experience as a graduate student researcher is considered central to the preparation for a future career whether in an academic or research environment. Depending on the field, students may begin work in research under the direction of a faculty advisor at various times following admission. Pre- dissertation and dissertation research are all guided by the same principals concerning ethical issues and classified or proprietary research. 
Responsibility for conducting research at the University of California is vested in the faculty. In some fields, graduate students may serve as research assistants on sponsored research grants or contracts under the guidance of a faculty member. The degree to which the research performed by a student is independently conceived and conducted will vary depending on both the nature of the field of research and the sponsorship. Academic appointment criteria for graduate students, as stated in this manual, are minimum University standards and requirements. Individual academic unit faculty retain the prerogative to apply stricter standards for research appointments within their academic unit. 
24 
Updated 1/17/19 
NOTE: UCI Graduate Student Researcher appointments are covered by University academic personnel policies. 
1. Graduate Student Researcher 
An academically qualified and registered graduate student, enrolled full-time, who performs research related to his or her degree program in an academic department or research unit under the direction of a faculty member or authorized Principal Investigator. The Graduate Student Researcher may or may not collaborate in the publication of said research. 
2. Graduate Student Assistant Researcher 
An academically qualified and registered graduate student, enrolled full-time, who performs research under the supervision of a Principal Investigator on a research project which is not related to the student’s degree program. 
Academic Qualifications for ASEs and Graduate Student Researchers: 
1. Enrollment Requirement:

25 
Updated 1/17/19 
Additional Academic Qualifications/Limitations for Teaching Assistants and Teaching Associates 
1. Teaching Assistant/Associate Quarter Limit 
Teaching Assistant/Associate appointments may not exceed 12 quarters prior to advancement to candidacy. Students must advance to candidacy towards their Ph.D. in order to be employed as a Teaching Assistant/Associate beyond 12 quarters. Teaching Assistant/Associate appointments cannot exceed 18 quarters total per student. Any quarter in which the student is appointed and compensated, at any amount/rate or percent time, is counted toward this maximum. This policy applies irrespective of whether a student enrolls in more than one academic program. Under no circumstances will a 19th quarter exception be granted. 
2. Doc2A Definition & Guidelines (Updated by Graduate Council 12/2013) 
By definition, a Doc2A student is enrolled more than nine (9) quarters past their advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The Doc2A quarter count begins with the quarter immediately following their advancement to candidacy date. The university does not receive state funding for students who are in Doc2A status nor are they included in official enrollment counts. Graduate students in Doc2A status may be appointed to GSR/GSAR titles at the hiring department’s discretion, provided they meet academic qualifications including enrollment and grade/GPA requirements, and are making satisfactory academic progress; and to ASE titles at the hiring department’s discretion if they are within the 18-quarter service limit for Teaching Assistants and Teaching Associates; meet academic qualifications including enrollment and grade/GPA requirements; and meet English language proficiency requirements for Teaching Assistants and Teaching Associates (for international and U.S. permanent resident students who are not citizens of countries where English is the primary or dominant language). 
3. English Language Proficiency Requirements 
International and U.S. Permanent Resident graduate students who are not citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language, as approved by the UCI Graduate Council, must pass one of the following English proficiency exams in order to be considered for appointment as a Teaching Assistant (TA) or Teaching Associate: 
▪ Test of English as a Foreign Language Internet-based Test (TOEFL iBT) 
▪ International English Language Testing System (IELTS) 
▪ UCI Campus SPEAK Test 
▪ UCI Campus TOEP – Test of English Oral Proficiency 
Achieving a minimum score of 26 in the speaking portion of the TOEFL iBT, a score of 8 in the speaking component of the IELTS, a score of 50 on the SPEAK Test, OR a score of 5 on the TOEP satisfies the oral English proficiency requirement and may establish eligibility for a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate appointment. Students are responsible for ensuring that the Graduate Division is notified directly of their scores by the testing centers. There is no exception to this requirement. 
The following students are exempt from the English language proficiency requirement: 
1) Citizens of the United States (regardless of country of origin) 
26 
Updated 1/17/19 
2) Citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council. Please contact the Graduate Student Employment Analyst in the Graduate Division for the list of countries that qualify for the exemption. 3) International and permanent resident graduate students whose native language is not 
English, who have completed all years of their high school education in the United States, are eligible to request an exemption by submitting a request and official high school transcripts to the Graduate Student Employment Analyst in the Graduate Division. No student is permitted to begin an appointment as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate until the exemption has been approved in writing. 
NOTE: Non-U.S. citizens who are permanent residents or hold other non-citizen status and are residing in the United States, who have completed their undergraduate education in the United States, or attended American schools abroad are still required to pass one of the English language proficiency examinations as noted. 
For graduate students who have an official TOEFL iBT or IELTS score report on file, a passing speaking section score will remain valid for a Teaching Assistant/Associate appointment beyond two years if the student has been continuously enrolled in a graduate program and taking classes every quarter without interruption. If a break in enrollment occurs (i.e. due to leave of absence, status lapse, etc.), or if there are English language proficiency issues during the teaching appointment (i.e. as demonstrated by student evaluations or faculty observations), the university reserves the right to require passage of a campus-based test before additional teaching appointments will be approved. 
4. Teaching Associate Additional Qualifications 
In addition to the general and basic qualifications for Teaching Assistants and Teaching Associates, all of the following additional qualifications apply for appointment as a Teaching Associate: 
1) A master’s degree or equivalent training. 2) At least one year of teaching experience (such as that of a Teaching Assistant) within or 
outside of the University. 
To teach an upper division course, a Teaching Associate must meet the following additional requirements: 
1) Advancement to candidacy for a Ph.D. degree. 2) Within normative time-to-degree. 3) In advance of the appointment, an exception approved in writing by the Graduate Dean and 
the UCI Academic Senate's Subcommittee on Courses. See Section IV. C. 1. Exceptions for additional information related to exception requests for Teaching Associate (Associate In) appointments. 
Benefits for Graduate Academic Student Employees (ASEs) 
a. Teaching Assistants, Teaching Associates, Readers and Tutors

▪ Eligible ASEs may request reimbursement for qualified childcare expenses. Please see the Graduate Division website for the maximum quarterly amount of reimbursement. Information on these and other employment-related benefits is contained in the ASE contract. 
1) Tutors and Readers 
Graduate students who are appointed as Tutors and Readers for less than 110 hours of assigned work, but subsequently complete 110 hours or more of work during the quarter will be entitled to reimbursement of the GSHIP premium and the partial fee remission, if paid from personal resources. If a graduate student’s fees/tuition and/or GSHIP were previously paid as a fellowship by the academic unit, upon completing 110 hours of work, the academic unit will be given an accounting credit for the costs associated with the partial fee remission and/or GSHIP as applicable. In no case will a student receive a direct cash payment if s/he did not incur any out-of-pocket expense related to fees or GSHIP; nor will the unit receive a credit for GSHIP if the student waived participation in the program. 
NOTE: After completion of 110 hours of assigned work during the service period by a graduate student Tutor or Reader, whose appointment notification letter did not guarantee a minimum of 110 hours of work, the academic unit is required to provide the following to the Graduate Division: 
• A written request via email for reimbursement to the student or an accounting credit to the department, signed by an appropriate departmental designee/authority, which includes the student’s name and both the employee and student identification numbers. 
The Graduate Division will review the request for reimbursement or accounting credit, approve it for processing, or contact the requesting department for clarification, if needed. 
Teaching Appointment Periods and Limitations 
The maximum academic student employee appointment limitation is 50% time (220 hours of assigned workload) during any academic year quarter. The assigned workload determines the percent of time of the appointment. 
If a graduate student has more than one appointment, the combination of all campus-wide appointments (including By Agreement appointments) may not exceed 50% time during any 
28 
Updated 1/17/19 
academic quarter. This workload includes specific required training (with the exception of pedagogy courses for which enrollment of the Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate may be required), time in the classroom, preparation time, grading, proctoring and office hours. Readers and Tutors are compensated on an hourly basis. Assigned workload is measured by how many hours the University could reasonably expect an ASE to satisfactorily complete the work assigned. (Related Documents: APM 110(40); APM 410-17b; APM 410 Appendix A; APM 420- 17c; Student Worker Guidelines (UCI/HR Compensation); 8CFR214.2fq) 
NOTE: When hiring a student from another academic unit, it is the hiring unit’s responsibility to coordinate with the student’s home department to determine eligibility for the appointment and to ensure that the student is not precluded from accepting employment because of other support, academic ineligibility, or other employment limitations. 
Selection and Assignment 
Among the considerations in departmental decisions regarding appointments of academic student employees (Teaching Assistants, Teaching Associates, Readers, and Tutors) is undergraduate student demand for courses, the availability of funds, and budgeted FTE (full- time equivalent) positions. Since the needs and resources of academic units vary, there is a considerable variation from one academic unit to another in the length and percentage of time for which students may be appointed. 
a. Campus-Wide Posting of Appointment Opportunities By March 15th of each year, anticipated employment opportunities for Academic Student Employees (ASEs) for the following academic year will be submitted by employing departments and posted on a central campus website. 
b. Appointment Notification Individuals offered an academic student employee appointment will be provided with written notification in spring quarter or as soon as practicable after hiring decisions are made. 
c. Supplemental Documentation At least 30 days prior to the commencement of a term, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the ASE will be provided with supplemental documentation, including: 
• faculty member or supervisor to whom the individual will report; 
• the location where the work will be performed, if known; 
• the class assigned, if applicable; 
• the duties that may be required and; 
• other information deemed appropriate by the University that was not included in the initial appointment notification. 
The University will provide notice when the above referenced duties are changed significantly. 
d. Training and Orientation All required training and orientation is considered part of the workload for the term, with the exception of pedagogy courses in which an ASE may be required to be enrolled. The University may require an ASE to satisfactorily complete required training to begin or to continue their appointment. The University may require that an ASE, who has not satisfactorily completed required training, repeat the training without it counting as workload.

Updated 1/17/19 
2) Graduate Student Researchers (GSR) and Graduate Student Assistant Researchers 
(GSAR) 1. Step Progression within Titles 
The Graduate Student Researcher title consists of 10 salary steps. Since inherent differences exist in academic disciplines at UCI, this policy provides flexibility to academic units. Each academic unit has the direct responsibility for establishing and implementing a written plan that ensures equitable compensation and treatment for all graduate students appointed to research positions within their unit. 
A copy of the school’s written plan(s), and any subsequent revisions, must be placed on file with the Graduate Division. An "academic unit" is defined as a “School” or “functional school equivalent,” but may be further re-defined as a “department”. The academic units retain the authority to administer all graduate student appointments within their unit. GSR/GSAR salary information is available on the Academic Personnel website. 
The Graduate Student Assistant Researcher title consists of two salary steps. Progression may be made from Level I to Level II depending on the student’s research experience as determined by the employing unit. 
2. Conditions of Appointment 
To clarify the nature and conditions of graduate student researcher appointments, the Graduate Council requires that each spring quarter all academic units provide the following: 
• Display departmental policies and criteria for the selection, appointment, and assignment of graduate student researchers. 
• Make explicit the extent to which continuing graduate student researchers in good standing may expect continued support. Continuing students should be notified during spring quarter regarding expected employment status for the upcoming academic year. Departments have an obligation to provide notification as early as possible to students whom they will be unable to support. 
• Send an offer letter in writing to graduate student researchers that outlines the nature and conditions of their appointment. The acceptance of an offer of employment is a binding agreement between the graduate student and the employing department. 
3. GSR and GSAR Appointment Benefits 
• Campus policy regarding GSR/GSAR fee and tuition remission applies to all students employed in the GSR/GSAR series with an appointment of at least 25% time for the entire quarter. Each eligible student’s total assessed fees/tuition (and nonresident supplemental tuition, if the student does not qualify for California residency status), must be paid as a condition of their GSR/GSAR appointment. Charges are to be debited directly to applicable extramural awards or other appropriate funding source(s) paying the student’s salary when the student registers each quarter. This policy takes precedence over all other types of student appointments. 
30 
Updated 1/17/19 
• Specifically, this policy also requires that, unless prohibited by the funding source, all GSR/GSAR fee and nonresident supplemental tuition remission payments must be debited to the same funding source that funds the GSR/GSAR’s salary and other benefits. Since all GSR/GSARs must be treated equally under this plan, campus funding sources (including departmental, fellowship, and other funds) must fund the remission for all eligible GSR/GSARs whose salaries are paid from General UCI Funds. Only if the sponsor generally prohibits remission of student fees may other University funds be used to fund the remission benefits. 
NOTE: The term “fees” is intended to include all graduate student fees/tuition as listed on the Registrar’s website; i.e., Student Services, Tuition, GSHIP, and miscellaneous campus-based fees. 
▪ Childbirth Accommodation Leave and Childcare Reimbursement for GSR/GSARs appointed at 25% time or more for the entire quarter. 
▪ Eligible GSR/GSARs may receive up to six weeks of paid Childbirth Accommodation Leave. 
▪ Eligible GSR/GSARs may request reimbursement for qualified childcare expenses. Please see the Graduate Division website for the maximum quarterly amount of reimbursement. 
4. GSR and GSAR Appointment Grievances 
Graduate Student Researchers who have concerns related to their appointments should consult with the faculty member in charge of the research activity. If the problem is not resolved by informal discussion it should be brought to the attention of the Department Chair and, if necessary, the Associate Dean or Academic Dean of the respective school. If no resolution can be achieved at the school level, concerns should be brought to the attention of the Graduate Dean. 
The Graduate Dean investigates the student’s concerns or grievances and determines appropriate resolutions. When circumstances warrant, every effort will be made by the Graduate Dean to protect the confidentiality of the student raising the concern. In cases in which informal procedures do not resolve the conflict, Section 140 of the Academic Personnel Manual (APM) provides formal grievance procedures for Graduate Student Researchers and Graduate Student Assistant Researchers. 
C. Other Employment Issues 
1. Exceptions to Policy 
General Guidelines: 
Requests for any exceptions to academic and personnel policies affecting a student’s appointment eligibility must be requested in advance by the hiring department chair/head or graduate advisor. 
All exception requests must be submitted in writing with appropriate signatures for review by the Graduate Dean. A complete justification and explanation of all relevant facts must be included. Exception requests are reviewed on a quarter-by-quarter basis. The written exception request must include all items as indicated on the checklist at the Graduate Division Forms page. 
2. Teaching Associate (Associate In) Exception Requests 
31 
Updated 1/17/19 
On an exception basis and upon written recommendation from the department chair/head or graduate advisor, a graduate student appointed as a Teaching Associate (Associate In) may be assigned to teach an upper-division course or course section with the written approval of the Graduate Dean and the UCI Academic Senate’s Subcommittee on Courses. If the hiring department is not the graduate student’s home department, the request must also be approved by the appropriate authority, i.e., department chair/head or graduate advisor within the home department. Exception requests generated from the Schools of Biological Sciences, Engineering, Humanities, ICS, Medicine, Social Ecology, or Social Sciences must also be approved and signed by the school’s Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. 
The written exception request must include all items as indicated on the checklist at the Graduate Division Forms page, be addressed to the Graduate Dean and the Subcommittee on Courses, and be forwarded to the Graduate Student Employment Analyst (120 Aldrich Hall, Zot 3180) for consideration/approval. If approved by the Graduate Dean, the request will be forwarded to the UCI Academic Senate’s Subcommittee on Courses for review and notification of the decision to the hiring department. Sufficient time, i.e., 5-6 weeks minimum, is required for the approval process. Final approval must occur prior to the issuance of an appointment notification to the graduate student and prior to the beginning of the teaching assignment. 
3. Service Limitations 
During any academic year quarter, a graduate student may not be appointed in any capacity by the University of California beyond a maximum of 50% time. The purpose of this University-wide policy is to limit the amount of time graduate students devote to University activities that do not lead directly to the successful completion of their academic degree program requirements in a timely manner. (Related Documents: APM 110 (40); APM 112 (39); APM 410-17b.; APM 410 Appendix A; APM 420-17c.; Student Worker Guidelines (UCI/HR Compensation); 8CFR 214.2f9) 
Graduate students are encouraged to voluntarily participate in worthwhile University or community activities such as student government, but they must make satisfactory progress toward their primary academic degree objectives. Before accepting additional obligations (compensated or not), graduate students are urged to consult their Graduate Advisor or the Associate Dean of their academic program. 
4. Late and Retroactive Appointments 
It is expected that ASEs and GSRs/GSARs will be appointed to relevant titles no later than the beginning of the quarter. 
Exception letters will be required if a department wishes to appoint a graduate student retroactively, two weeks or more beyond the start of the normal service period. A written exception request should be addressed to the Graduate Dean and forwarded to the Graduate Student Employment Analyst (120 Aldrich Hall, Zot 3180), and must be approved prior to entering the appointment into the University’s payroll system. An exception is not required for a retroactive fund change. Consult your Contracts and Grants Officer if the retroactive fund change is against an extramural fund source and applies to over 120 days ago. 
Exception requests resulting from a delay in grant funding cannot be approved. Any late appointment exception requests must be infrequent and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
32 
Updated 1/17/19 
5. Appointments between Academic Sessions 
Graduate students, other than those receiving agency-restricted fellowship or training grant stipends, may be appointed full-time between academic year sessions (quarters) or during a summer recess. During these periods, aggregate compensated UC employment in a given month may not exceed 100% time. (Related Documents: APM 110 (40); 8CFR 214.2f9) 
6. Employment of Part-Time Graduate Students 
Preference for employment will be given to full-time graduate students (enrolled in 12 units or more). Part-time graduate students (enrolled in 8 units or less) may be appointed as Readers, Tutors, or in other appropriate titles, but combined campus-wide employment cannot exceed 25% time (110 hours of assigned workload) during any academic quarter. 
7. Employment of Graduate Students Participating on Training Grants 
a. Student Employment It is recognized that trainees may need to seek part-time employment coincidental to their training program to further offset their expenses or to meet academic degree requirements. The academic units may provide additional funds in the form of employment (as salary and applicable fee/tuition remission) for services such as a TA, GSR, Reader, etc. but only on a limited part-time basis. UCI's Graduate Council defines limited part-time basis as employment not to exceed 75% time over the three quarters of an academic year; e.g., 25%-time for the fall, winter, and spring contiguous quarters would result in the maximum limit. Aggregate employment shall not exceed 75% for one academic year session. 
b. Student Compensation Paid from Research Grants Training grants may not be used to fund student employment. If a student supported on a training grant is also employed on another research grant, the project must be separate and unrelated to the research funded by the training grant. Such employment may not interfere with, detract from, or prolong the student’s training program. 
8. Employment of Students Registered in Self-Supporting Programs 
Graduate students who are registered in self-supporting programs are not eligible for appointments in student employment titles. A list of Self-Supporting Graduate Degree Programs is available at the Registrar’s website. 
9. Employment of Students Registered in the Medical Doctorate Degree Program 
Due to the academic rigor of pursuing a Medical Doctorate (M.D.) degree, students registered in the program are not eligible for appointments in student employment titles. 
10. Employment of Graduate Students from Other UC Campuses 
If eligible, graduate students from other UC campuses may be employed at UCI. These UC graduate students could include visitors, intercampus exchange students, or those enrolled in a multi-campus program. No graduate student from another UC campus is permitted to begin an 
33 
Updated 1/17/19 
appointment that has not met all of the applicable academic criteria and completed the process outlined below: 
• Written approval from the student’s home department. 
• Written approval from the home campus and UCI Graduate Division. 
• Verification that the graduate student has registered and paid appropriate fees at the home campus is required prior to commencement of employment at UCI. Verification that student meets UCI academic criteria (see Academic Student Employee Titles (ASEs) 
• Submission of an exception request, if appropriate 
11. Taxation of Student Wages 
Compensation or wages for a Graduate Student Researcher, Graduate Student Assistant Researcher, Teaching Assistant, Teaching Associate (Associate In), Reader, and Tutor are paid through the University payroll system and are subject to federal and state tax withholding. 
12. Academic Credit for Supervised University Teaching 
For academic units that appoint graduate student Teaching Assistants, the Registrar has assigned appropriate course codes and listed a 399 course titled “University Teaching” in the Schedule of Classes. Although use of such a course is not required, it is recommended that graduate students who engage in supervised University teaching (under the supervision of a member of the UCI faculty) enroll for one to four units of 399 credit per quarter only when this activity is part of the student’s training. 
13. Volunteers & Other Titles 
Students performing the duties of an ASE (Academic Student Employee) must be appropriately appointed in an ASE title and compensated through the Irvine payroll system for their time and effort. Students may not perform ASE duties while appointed in other academic or staff titles, or as volunteers. Additionally, the stipend from a fellowship may not be used as a substitute for salary for an academic appointment. 
V. ENROLLMENT AND REGISTRATION POLICY: STUDENT STATUS 
A. Academic Residence Requirements 
1. Academic Year 
(Irvine Regulations [IR] SR 688, 690, and 694) 
According to University of California academic policy, a graduate student is considered to be in residence during an academic quarter only if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division undergraduate or graduate-level courses. Except in cases where off- campus study conforms with Senate Regulation 694, which addresses UC requirements for higher degrees, and is approved by the Graduate Dean in consultation with the student's respective academic unit, no graduate student will be recommended for any degree who has not completed at least one year of residence. 
2. Summer Session 
34 
Updated 1/17/19 
For a candidate for a doctorate degree, and in accordance with UC regulations, residence during a Summer Session may be counted only under either of the following conditions: (1) enrollment in two consecutive six-week Summer Sessions, which counts as one term of residence provided the candidate is enrolled in each session for the equivalent of at least two units of upper division and/or graduate level coursework as given in a regular term; or (2) enrollment in a 10-week Summer Session, which counts as one term of residence provided the candidate is enrolled for the equivalent of at least four units of upper division and/or graduate work as given in a regular quarter. For a candidate for a Master's degree, the same basic criteria apply except that the two six-week Summer Sessions need not be consecutive. 
3. California Residency and Nonresident Supplemental Tuition 
All new graduate students, and students returning from one year of academic leave of absence, are required to complete and submit a Statement of Legal Residence to UCI's Registrar's Office to determine their official residency status. Questions about California residence and nonresident supplemental tuition should be directed to the UCI Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office at (949) 824-6124 or regres@uci.edu. More information about California Residency classification is available at the Registrar’s website. 
B. Enrollment Policies and Procedures 
1. Full-Time Enrollment/Registration 
Full-time academic registration is generally expected of all graduate students at the University of California. Full-time registration is defined as 1) payment of applicable University fees/tuition; and 2) enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate-level academic coursework in a given quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching occurring during the academic year. (During the summer, full-time registration is defined as payment of applicable University fees and enrollment in at least six units of upper-division or graduate level academic credits.) However, continuing UCI graduate students are generally considered to be enrolled students between successive spring and fall quarters. Graduate students may enroll in lower- division courses with the approval of their faculty academic advisor, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program and will not count toward satisfying degree requirements. Full-time academic registration during regular academic quarters is required of all graduate students holding University-administered fellowships. 
NOTE: The campus's budgetary allocation in support of graduate education is calculated on the basis of Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) enrollment at the end of the third week of the quarter and for three years following advancement to candidacy. Academic units should therefore strongly encourage their students to register no later than the end of the third week of classes. Failure to do so will result in reduced student funding for UCI as well as a lapse of status for the student. Graduate advisors are further encouraged to give careful consideration to the validity of reasons for student requests for leave of absence or Filing Fee status before recommending approval. (Section V. C. Registration Policy). 
Course Load Limitations: Graduate students should not enroll for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate level coursework, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in combination. Course loads in excess of 16 units of graduate level and/or upper-division credit must be approved in advance by the student's graduate advisor, and written notification must be sent by the Faculty Graduate Advisor to the Graduate Dean. 
35 
Updated 1/17/19 
2. Part-Time Enrollment/Registration 
In most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study. However, UCI recognizes that a legitimate need may exist for part-time study, and it may be allowable under certain circumstances, if academically feasible. Part-time status generally applies to enrollment in part-time master's degree programs. However, on the recommendation of the academic unit, students admitted to a Ph.D. program may be approved by the Graduate Dean for part-time status on an ad hoc basis for up to three consecutive quarters. 
Requests for part-time status must be submitted in writing to the Graduate Dean and signed by the Departmental Faculty Graduate Advisor (some schools require, in addition, the signature of the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies in the academic unit). 
UCI policy defines part-time enrollment at the graduate level during the academic year as enrollment in one to eight units. Within the guidelines and limitations listed below, graduate students may petition for part-time status. If approved, students will pay UCI the full Student Services Fee, all student activities fees, the health insurance (GSHIP) premium, one-half the Tuition, and one-half the Nonresident Supplemental Tuition (if applicable). Students on part- time status, if applicable, will pay only one-half of the Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition. (NOTE: The Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition is not applicable for students in the EMBA, FEMBA, or HCEMBA programs in the School of Business or the Master of Advanced Study in Criminology, Law and Society in the School of Social Ecology as these programs charge a single Program Fee.) 
a. Guidelines to Establish Part-Time Eligibility 
A completed petition for the Reduced Fee Part-Time Study Program approved by the Departmental Faculty Graduate Advisor (and Associate Dean, if required by the school), and a memo from the Graduate Advisor in support of the request must be submitted to the Graduate Dean. The memo should include: 
• A brief explanation of the motivation for the part-time status request 
• A statement of how part-time status might impact the student's progress toward degree, and steps to be taken to minimize any negative impact; and 
• An indication of when part-time status would, if approved, begin and end (e.g., fall- spring). 
• To be effective for that academic quarter, the Petition must be received by the Graduate Division no later than noon on Wednesday of the third week of classes. There are no exceptions to this deadline. 
b. Part-Time Limitations and Related Policies 
1) Purpose: Unless enrolled in an approved part-time master's degree program, approval of part-time enrollment status may be granted only for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, health, or professional development. 
2) Citizenship: Ordinarily, graduate students who are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States are not eligible for part-time enrollment because of overriding federal regulations governing student visa status. Please contact the UCI International Center for further information. International students who are eligible to petition for part-time status are required to obtain written approval by the UCI International Center prior to submitting a request to the Graduate Division. 
36 
Updated 1/17/19 
3) Fellowships: All University fellowships require full-time enrollment in graduate level courses. For extramural fellowships, students must refer to and adhere to the individual agency guidelines established by the sponsor; if the sponsor does not specify then campus policies apply. 
4) Academic Appointments: Part-time status may affect academic appointments/employment. Please see Section IV, Academic Appointments and Graduate Student Employment, for more information. 
5) Satisfactory Academic Standing: Students must be within time-to-degree limits for their program and must be making satisfactory academic progress. 
6) Student Loans: All students considering applying for part-time status should be cautioned that, in most instances, they will no longer be eligible for deferment of student loan repayment obligations. It is the student's responsibility to discuss this matter with their loan agency. 
7) Student Housing and Other Services: Part-time status may affect eligibility for student services, including student housing. Students living on-campus who are also interested in part-time status should check with their housing office. 
8) Maximum Time: Petitions for part-time status may be requested for a maximum of three consecutive quarters. To continue after a third quarter on part-time status, the student must submit a new petition by the respective quarter deadline and obtain an exception to policy. 
9) Enrollment Limits: If the student exceeds the approved part-time enrollment limit of eight units, the student will be billed by UCI for the balance of the respective quarter's full-time student fees/tuition (including nonresident supplemental tuition, if applicable) and will not be permitted to register for a subsequent quarter until the required fees/tuition are paid in full. 
3. Lapse of Status: Did Not Enroll 
At UCI, graduate students are expected to remain continuously enrolled in their degree program while progressing toward their degree. Students who have failed to maintain their graduate student status will be notified in writing by the Graduate Division. A lapse of status will occur under any of the following conditions: 
a. If a student fails to register (i.e., pay fees and enroll in units) by Friday of the third week 
of classes. b. If an academic leave of absence, or permission to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of 
registration, has not been submitted and approved by the student's department and Graduate Division. c. If a student fails to comply with any provisions of admission to UCI. 
Final notification of lapse of student status will be sent to the student and the academic unit at the beginning of the fourth week of classes. Students wishing to re-enroll retroactively within the same quarter must provide Graduate Division with a completed readmission petition which requires payment of a Readmission Fee and applicable signatures, as well as a written exception 
37 
Updated 1/17/19 
request signed by their Department Chair/Program Director and Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs requesting reinstatement and justifying the request for change in student status. Approval of such requests is rare and is given under truly exceptional circumstances only. In most cases, students wishing to re-enroll will be required to submit a new Application for Graduate Study. 
4. Lapse of Status: Readmission 
Prior to resuming graduate study at the University, a student who previously withdrew, or who failed to meet the continuous registration requirement, must request readmission from the academic program and the Graduate Division by submitting a new Application for Graduate Study with the full, non-refundable application fee applicable at that time. However, graduate students who were not enrolled within the previous two years should submit, in addition to the completed application form, an updated statement of purpose, and transcripts covering all academic work since their last enrollment at UCI. 
Readmission of former UCI graduate students without academic standing may be granted only by the Graduate Dean and only upon recommendation by the academic unit, and is not guaranteed. If readmitted, a student’s previous academic work may be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the faculty graduate advisor and the Graduate Dean. Previous academic work is less likely to be applied if a significant period of time has elapsed since the student was enrolled. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and must satisfy certain requirements a second time, including formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student will also be expected to complete at least one additional academic quarter in residence before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the second quarter following readmission. 
5. Enrollment in University Extension 
If a graduate student wishes to enroll for credit in a University Extension course while registered or while on an approved Leave of Absence, the student's proposed program of study must be approved in advance by the Graduate Dean with the written recommendation of the student's faculty advisor. See Section VII. H. Transfer of Credit, for information on transfer of credit for courses taken in University Extension. 
6. Withdrawal 
a. Withdrawal between Quarters 
A student who plans to withdraw after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment should submit a written notice of intent to the Graduate Division and to their department as soon as the decision to withdraw has been made. The student has two options in such cases: (1) to file a Withdrawal form with the Graduate Division; or (2) to apply for an academic leave of absence. A student in good academic standing who intends to re-enroll after missing no more than three consecutive quarters is encouraged to consider a leave of absence. 
b. Withdrawal after Enrollment and Fee Payment 
A student who decides to leave the University after paying fees and enrolling for a regular academic term must file the Withdrawal form with the Graduate Division. If unable to do so in person because of emergency or serious illness, the student should notify the Graduate Division by mail or e-mail (grad@uci.edu) as soon as possible so that timely assistance may be provided. 
38 
Updated 1/17/19 
Failure to do so will result in the assignment of failing grades in all courses in which the student is enrolled, and will jeopardize further academic standing. Note that students who withdraw after paying fees for the quarter are subject to the Registrar’s Schedule of Refunds. 
c. Withdrawal Without Approved Academic Leave of Absence 
A student who withdraws, but has not been granted an academic leave of absence by the Graduate Dean, must apply for readmission in order to resume graduate study at UCI. 
C. Registration Policy 
1. Continuous Registration Policy 
A graduate student is expected to register for each regular academic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Registration at UCI consists of two separate steps: 1) payment of applicable student fees/tuition; and 2) enrollment in applicable units. Both steps, payment of fees and enrollment in classes, must be completed for the student to be officially registered. Registration may be accomplished online via WebReg. 
2. Registration Procedures 
Detailed registration procedures are outlined at the Registrar’s website. Students are personally responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct and completed, and have their fees paid, no later than the end of the third week of each quarter. Unless granted an official Academic Leave of Absence or approval to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration, a graduate student who does not register for any quarter will be considered to have withdrawn from the University, and their respective fee assessment will be cancelled by the Registrar. In such cases, student status and candidacy for any degree will lapse, and any student wishing to continue with their graduate studies at UCI will be required to apply for readmission. 
3. In-Absentia Registration 
Students may apply for in absentia status if the following criteria are met: the research or coursework is of a nature that makes it necessary to be completed outside of California (or, in some cases by exception, within California but outside the Southern California area e.g. not residing/working in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside or San Diego county) for at least one full academic term; the work away from the UC campus is directly related to the student’s degree program as evidenced by UC faculty approval; the work involves only indirect supervision (correspondence or review of written work) from UC faculty during the in absentia period; the work involves no significant collaboration with UC faculty during the in absentia period. Doctoral students who want to register in absentia for a second academic year must reapply. A health insurance fee, non-resident tuition (if applicable), professional school fees (if applicable), and reduced Educational and Registration Fees; as well as the Associated Graduate Students (AGS) fee, are charged to all students registered in absentia. 
While on In-absentia status, policy normally requires students to enroll in 12 units (typically for dissertation research or independent study courses), and pay the required quarterly fees/tuition. However, students on In-absentia status pay a reduced rate of 15% of the combined University Student Services and Tuition fees, as well as the AGS fee and GSHIP, if applicable. 39 
Updated 1/17/19 
The procedures for enrolling are the same as for regular students who are in-residence on campus. If In-absentia registration is approved by the academic department and the Graduate Dean, the Graduate Division will send notice of an In-Absentia Waiver to the UCI Student Billing System. The student will then be billed for the fees/tuition due, with the Waiver appearing on the student’s Zotbill as a credit. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure fee payment by the deadline established by the Registrar and to submit all applications and petitions in a timely manner to ensure that their fees are assessed appropriately and prior to all deadlines. 
4. Academic Leave of Absence 
A Leave of Absence (LOA) may be granted for up to one academic year (3 quarters) if, following review of the student's academic record, it is deemed consistent with the student's academic objectives and progress toward degree. Written approvals are required from the Faculty Graduate Student Advisor and/or the school's Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs (both signatures are required in the Schools of Biological Sciences, Engineering, Humanities, Medicine, Social Ecology, Social Sciences and ICS), and the Graduate Dean. It is important that applications for LOA status be submitted to the Graduate Dean (120 Aldrich Hall) prior to the beginning of the quarter for which approval is sought. 
a. Purpose An LOA is intended to cover the temporary interruption of the student's academic program. The reason(s) for requesting an LOA must be consistent with University policy and guidelines as outlined below, and with the student's academic program guidelines. 
b. Eligibility Guidelines A leave may be granted when a student plans to be away from the University of California for one of the following reasons: 
1) Serious illness or other temporary disability. 2) Concentration on an occupation not directly related to the student's academic 
program. 3) Responsibilities related to family obligations. 4) Temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate 
reasons. 
c. Limitations to LOA 
LOA policy does NOT apply under the following circumstances: 
1) If a student will be absent from the campus and outside California while continuing to pursue graduate research or scholarly activity. (Students engaged in such activity outside California must register In-Absentia.) 2) If a student must leave the academic program for more than three quarters. Under such circumstances students should withdraw and apply for readmission at the time they expect to resume graduate study at UCI. 3) If a student requests such action retroactively. 4) If a student has not completed at least one quarter of graduate study at UCI. 5) If a student has not demonstrated satisfactory academic progress. (Please refer to Section VI. A. Progress toward Degree.) 
40 
Updated 1/17/19 
d. Procedures for Requesting an Academic Leave of Absence A request for an LOA requires submission of a Graduate Division Academic Leave of Absence form. The form should be submitted to Graduate Division (120 Aldrich Hall) prior to the registration deadline for the quarter requested. A request for leave submitted after the end of the third week of classes will be granted by exception only. 
In those cases where the fees have been paid, a Withdrawal form, available from the Registrar's Office or Graduate Division (120 Aldrich Hall), must also accompany the LOA form in order to obtain a refund. 
e. Other Policies Relevant to LOA 
1) Academic Appointments and Employment: A student on an approved leave may not be employed by the University of California in any capacity. 
2) Degree Requirements: A student on leave cannot take qualifying examinations for advancement to candidacy or final examinations for the degree, nor pursue their graduate studies on the UCI campus in any other manner. A student may not receive academic credit for work done at another institution during the leave period unless an exception is approved in advance by the Graduate Dean. 
3) Fee Refunds: If fees have been paid for the quarter the leave is requested, the LOA form, as noted above, must be submitted together with a Withdrawal form. Students must indicate on the Withdrawal form, under Reason for Withdrawal, “LOA”. The refund schedule is printed on the back of the Withdrawal form. The effective date for the refund is the date the form is submitted to the Graduate Division (120 Aldrich Hall). Note that the GSHIP premium will be refunded only if the Withdrawal form is submitted before the first day of the quarter. 
4) Filing Fee Restriction: Immediately following an LOA, students are required to register. They will not be eligible to be on Filing Fee status. 
5) Financial Support: While on an academic LOA, a student is not eligible for University fellowships, University research grants, or financial aid support. In addition, the student will, in most cases, lose eligibility for deferment of student loan obligations. It is the responsibility of the student to contact their loan agency to verify their loan status before applying for academic LOA. 
6) Health Insurance: A student on leave will not be covered by the graduate student health insurance (GSHIP) program unless the student self-pays for continued coverage. Students should contact Student Health at (949) 824-5301 or refer to their website. 
7) Housing: LOA status may affect eligibility for student housing. Students living on campus who are contemplating an academic LOA should check directly with their housing office for more information. 
8) International Students: In accordance with visa restrictions, a student who is not a permanent resident or citizen of the U.S. is not permitted to take an academic LOA. Any exception to this policy requires written approval by UCI's International Center as 
41 
Updated 1/17/19 
indicated on the LOA form. Following receipt of such approval the form must then be submitted to the Graduate Division (120 Aldrich Hall). 
9) Library Privileges: A student on leave will lose library privileges. Students should contact the library for more information. In some cases, special arrangements can be made with the library to maintain privileges. 
5. Filing Fee Status 
UCI's Academic Senate policy on Filing Fee status applies to students who have completed all requirements for a terminal Master's or Doctoral degree and are ready for the formal submission of their thesis or dissertation, or the final, formal examination. The Filing Fee may be paid in lieu of registration for only one academic quarter or summer during the student's entire graduate career, irrespective of how many graduate programs students enroll in. Students applying for Filing Fee status must be registered in the preceding academic session. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following an academic LOA. 
a. Establishing Eligibility for Filing Fee Status 
To establish eligibility to pay the Filing Fee, the student must submit a Graduate Division Filing Fee Petition. The Petition must be approved by the departmental Faculty Graduate Advisor and the Chair of the thesis or doctoral committee and must certify that all other requirements for the degree have been met. Students in the Schools of Biological Sciences, Engineering, Humanities, ICS, Medicine, Social Sciences, and Social Ecology, also need to obtain the signature of their Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs. International students, in addition, must secure approval from the International Center to go on Filing Fee status. It is important that applications for Filing Fee be submitted to the Graduate Dean prior to or at the very beginning of the quarter. 
The completed Filing Fee form should be brought to the Cashier's Office with a check made out for one-half of the Student Services fee. The form should then be submitted to the Graduate Division for final approval/processing. 
Note: Students in Self-Supporting Graduate Professional Degree Programs (SSGPDPs) are only eligible for Filing Fee status if they have already enrolled for their program’s full normative time and paid the entire program fee. 
b. Limitations on Use of University Services While on Filing Fee Status 
While on Filing Fee status a student may seek faculty involvement for a final reading of his or her dissertation or thesis. A student may also take the final oral examination. However, students may not pay the Filing Fee if they are still doing research or if any other use of University facilities or faculty time is anticipated. Additional restrictions while on Filing Fee status include the following: 
1) Loss of eligibility for University administered financial assistance. 2) Loss of student services such as health services, including health insurance (GSHIP). Students may, however, arrange to self-pay. 3) Possible loss of student housing or library privileges. Students are encouraged to contact the Housing Office and Library for more information. 4) Loss of eligibility status for UCI academic or student appointments. 5) Loss of eligibility in most cases for deferment of student loan repayment obligations. 
42 
Updated 1/17/19 
If, after paying the Filing Fee, the student finds it necessary to use the educational facilities of the University in any way other than those described in this section, the student must cancel the Filing Fee and register for full-time status. Further, if all requirements are not completed during the quarter for which the Filing Fee was paid, the student must register for full-time status for any subsequent quarter. To do so the student must contact the Graduate Division in order to be reassessed fees for the next quarter. 
Students wishing to earn a degree over the summer must be enrolled in units or on Filing Fee status. All summer Filing Fee requirements and policies are similar to those stated above with the exception of the items listed below. You can find the summer Filing Fee form on the Graduate Division website. 
• The student applying for Filing Fees status in summer must have been registered in the preceding spring academic quarter. 
• For summer Filing Fee only, students may receive fellowship support or UCI employment while on summer Filing Fee. 
• Students registered and covered with GSHIP for spring quarter and on Filing Fee status during summer: maintain GSHIP coverage, student housing and library privileges through the end of summer. 
• Note: Students in Self-Supporting Graduate Professional Degree Programs (SSGPDPs) are only eligible for Filing Fee status if they have already enrolled for their program’s full normative time and paid the entire program fee. 
6. Terminal Master's Students 
Students pursuing a terminal master's degree may not continue to register as a graduate student subsequent to a degree award unless formally admitted to a doctoral program. To be considered for admission to a doctoral program, the student must submit a new Application for Graduate Study. 
D. Doc2A Definition & Guidelines 
(Updated by Graduate Council 12/2013) 
By definition, a Doc2A student is enrolled more than 9 quarters past their advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The Doc2A quarter count begins with the quarter immediately following their advancement to candidacy date. The university does not receive state funding for students who are in Doc2A status nor are they included in official enrollment counts. Graduate students in Doc2A status may be appointed to GSR/GSAR titles at the hiring department’s discretion, provided they meet academic qualifications including enrollment and grade/GPA requirements, and are making satisfactory academic progress; and to ASE titles at the hiring department’s discretion if they are within the 18-quarter service limit for Teaching Assistants and Teaching Associates; meet academic qualifications including enrollment and grade/GPA requirements; and meet English language proficiency requirements for Teaching Assistants and Teaching Associates (for international and U.S. permanent resident students who are not citizens of countries where English is the primary or dominant language). 
E. Nonresident Supplemental Tuition Reduction for Nonresident Doctoral Students 
43 
Updated 1/17/19 
(International Students) 
Nonresident doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy are eligible for a 100% reduction in the non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST) for a maximum of three consecutive calendar years including time on leave of absence. The reduction in NRST begins with the first academic term following advancement to candidacy, and is based on the prevailing NRST rate for the year it is applied. Any nonresident student who continues to be registered, or who re-registers following the three-year maximum allowance, will be charged the full NRST rate that is in effect at that time of enrollment. The student must be advanced to candidacy as of the first day of the quarter to qualify for the NRST reduction. A nonresident student is eligible for the reduced NRST for only one doctoral degree when he or she is enrolled at the University. 
F. Intercampus Exchange Program 
1. What is Intercampus Exchange? 
Through the Intercampus Exchange Program graduate students may take advantage of unique educational opportunities at another University of California campus. Students may also take courses on more than one campus of the University in the same academic session. The program is reserved for those students whose graduate study may be enhanced by work with distinguished faculty or use of facilities and resources accessible only on another UC campus. 
2. Eligibility for Intercampus Exchange 
Students must have completed at least one quarter of graduate study at the University and be in good standing (3.0 cumulative GPA) to be eligible to apply for Intercampus Exchange. Approvals by the departmental graduate faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the Deans of the respective graduate offices are required. 
3. Procedures 
Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program are available on the Graduate Division website and should be submitted to the Graduate Division at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter for which Intercampus Exchange is desired. If approved, the exchange student pays fees and enrolls at UCI (see a. and b. below) by the published deadlines, and then enrolls at the host campus. Fees at the host campus are waived. Students earn credit toward academic residence requirements at UCI, while the host campus provides library privileges and other student services. The exchange student is responsible for complying with the policies, procedures, and deadlines of the host campus Registrar. Although eligible for all regular student services, the exchange student is a visitor, and not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. 
a. Financial Aid and Intercampus Exchange 
The Registrar reports student status to financial aid lending institutions on a quarterly basis. If a student's record does not show full-time enrollment, the lending institution may set in motion the process for repayment of the student loan. Students who enroll in courses on two campuses in a given quarter, and in fewer than 12 units on each of the two campuses during that quarter, will not be considered full-time students even if the total number of units is 12 or more unless they 
44 
Updated 1/17/19 
enroll in a "place-holder course" at UCI. The place-holder course numbers are listed by campus; please contact the Graduate Division to obtain the applicable place-holder course number. The student should identify the appropriate course number, pay fees and enroll online using WebReg before the second week of classes. 
4. Joint (Intercampus) Degree Program Students 
Students in joint/intercampus degree programs should also enroll and register as Intercampus Exchange students when they are taking classes on a participating campus other than UCI. There may be some important exceptions to the regular policy on intercampus exchange, including additional services that may be available on the participating campus, and a more streamlined enrollment/registration procedure. Students should consult with their home department/program or the Graduate Division for more information. 
5. Coursework Credit 
A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses involved are encouraged, in order to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the student's needs. Whether or not the coursework at the host campus applies toward the student's program requirements is at the discretion of the Faculty Advisor/Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs of the student's academic unit. Therefore, the student should consult with the appropriate individual(s) prior to enrolling in a given course. 
If a graduate student undertakes coursework through Intercampus Exchange in the quarter in which the degree award is expected, and if that coursework is to be applied toward degree requirements, the degree can be conferred only when the approved credit for the coursework is posted to the student's UCI academic record. In such circumstances, to avoid delays or problems in the degree award process, the student should contact the Registrar of the host campus and order a transcript of the work completed to be sent directly to the Graduate Division. The student should also notify the Graduate Division in writing that the transcript has been requested. 
VI. ACADEMIC STANDARDS FOR STUDENTS 
A. Progress toward Degree 
1. Satisfactory Progress 
A graduate student is expected to maintain satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective as defined by the faculty of the program, and in accordance with policies of the Graduate Council and the University. It is important that the academic record of the student be assessed each quarter to confirm satisfactory progress. The academic unit should inform the Graduate Division by contacting the Enrolled Student Affairs Officer of any action taken with regard to a student's academic record, and should provide copies of any related correspondence between the department/program and the student. 
Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of both the student's recent academic record and overall performance. The criteria for determining satisfactory progress toward degree are outlined below. Student records should be reviewed with special attention to the following criteria: 
45 
Updated 1/17/19 
• GPA - the student must maintain at least a 3.0 cumulative grade point average. 
• Normal Time to Degree – the student must advance to candidacy and complete the degree within the limitations established by UCI’s Graduate Council (March 2004). A student exceeding the maximal time to degree shall be deemed not to be making satisfactory progress toward their degree; moreover, they shall not be eligible to receive University resources (e.g., financial aid, TA-ships, housing, etc.). Per UCI’s Graduate Council, beginning with students entering in fall 2010, the Graduate Dean will not permit students to enroll past their programs’ maximum time to degree (June 2009). Any exception request must be made in writing directly to the Graduate Dean and will be considered in cases involving extenuating circumstances beyond the student’s control. The exception request must include a plan and timeline for completion of the degree, must be signed by the student’s program advisor and Associate Dean, and must be submitted at least one quarter in advance of maximum time to degree. Note that leaves of absence of up to three quarters and time allotted for parental leave are not counted toward a student’s normative or maximum time to degree. Normal Time to Degree for each graduate program is listed in the General Catalogue and on the Graduate Division website. 
• Grade Reports - all I, W, or NR grades should be reviewed and appropriate action taken as needed. 
• P/NP - no courses graded "Pass" are to be included as part of the advanced degree program, nor are they to be considered as satisfying academic criteria for University-administered fellowships and academic appointments/employment. 
• Enrollment Units - students must be enrolled for at least 12 graduate or upper-division units of credit each quarter, including credit for supervised teaching and research, unless part-time status or an academic leave of absence has been approved in advance by the Graduate Dean. In cases of approved part-time status, enrollment in eight (8) or fewer units of credit toward the degree is expected each quarter. 
• Distribution of units - the number of upper-division and graduate-level units of credit completed toward degree requirements each quarter should be at least eight and no more than 16 units, unless an exception has been approved.. 
• Residency - time in residence prior to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. or professional doctorate degree should be within acceptable limits (ordinarily, no more than four years). 
2. Unsatisfactory Progress 
A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory academic progress is not eligible for any academic appointment/employment, fellowship support or other awards. 
a. Criteria for Determining Unsatisfactory Progress 
• An overall grade point average below 3.0; or 
• A grade point average below 3.0 in two successive quarters; or 
• Fewer than 24 units completed and applicable toward the advanced degree requirements in the last three quarters; or 
• Failure to complete required courses or examinations satisfactorily within the period specified by the graduate program; or 
• Failure to pass a required examination in two attempts; or 
• Failure to progress academically within the Normal Time to Degree framework specified for the student’s graduate program; or 
46 
Updated 1/17/19 
• The appropriate faculty committee's evaluation that there has not been satisfactory progress toward completion of the thesis or dissertation. 
NOTE: Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements such as those outlined above. However, the professional judgment of the faculty, upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student, is paramount, and the faculty of a particular academic unit may establish more restrictive criteria for satisfactory academic progress. 
b. Notice of Unsatisfactory Progress 
It is very important to give students an early warning of potentially unsatisfactory progress. Faculty advisors must be direct and clearly communicate orally and in writing with students demonstrating academic difficulties at the earliest possible time, and must keep a written record of all such communications. Notices of potential unsatisfactory progress must be sent in writing to the student; a copy must also be retained in the academic unit files and another copy sent to the Graduate Dean (120 Aldrich Hall). The written communication must include specific details on areas that require improvement, provide an outline and a timeline for future expectations of academic progress, and set meeting dates to maintain continuity in advisement. The purpose of the notice of potential unsatisfactory progress is to provide the student with a period of time (usually at least one academic quarter) in which to make the necessary improvement in their academic status, and successfully complete their graduate study. 
If requested by the academic unit to do so, the Graduate Dean will also send a notice of potential unsatisfactory progress to the student. 
3. Academic Disqualification Policy (Amended by Graduate Council 11/2015) 
Section I. Definitions 
A. Disqualification vs. Dismissal Disqualification means that, for one or more of the academic reasons listed below, a student is no longer eligible to continue graduate study in his/her graduate program at the University of California, Irvine. The term “dismissal” should not be confused with “disqualification.” Dismissal is an administrative action resulting in removal from graduate study based on behavior or conduct. Authority to terminate student status as a result of disciplinary proceedings rests with the Dean of Students. 
1. “Graduate Dean” means the Dean of the Graduate Division at the University of 
California, Irvine. 
2. “Graduate Advisor” means the graduate student’s faculty advisor. 
3. “Associate Dean” – means the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies for the student’s degree granting School 
4. “Academic Conditional Status” –Prior language also used was ‘Academic Probation.’ 
Section II. Academic Disqualification 
47 
Updated 1/17/19 
A. General Policy. 
1. Recommendation for Disqualification. If a graduate student’s Graduate Advisor determines that a graduate student is making unsatisfactory academic progress as determined by any of the factors noted in this section, the Graduate Advisor shall consult with the appropriate faculty and administrators for that degree granting unit (e.g. Associate Dean, Chair, Thesis Advisor, etc.) before drafting a letter to notify the graduate student in writing that he or she has been recommended for academic disqualification. The letter will be vetted and approved at the School level by the Associate Dean and sent to the student. A copy of the letter will then be sent to the Graduate Dean. 
2. Disqualification by Graduate Dean. After consultation with the graduate student’s academic unit faculty, the Graduate Dean may disqualify a graduate student because of unsatisfactory academic progress as determined by any of the factors noted in this section. Should the Graduate Dean determine that disqualification is warranted under this section, the Graduate Dean shall notify the graduate student in writing of the disqualification determination. 
3. Withdrawal by Mutual Agreement. In those cases in which the graduate student and the academic unit mutually agree to the termination status, either to end graduate study with a Master’s Degree or to simply withdraw from graduate study, then the academic unit and/or graduate student may independently notify the other of this mutual agreement. In all such cases, the department shall provide the Graduate Division a copy of the mutual agreement to terminate. The department shall direct that notice to the Enrolled Student Affairs Officer at 120 Aldrich Hall. 
4. Grounds for Placement on Academic Conditional Status 
a. Events Triggering Automatic Placement on Academic Conditional Status. The following events result in a graduate student’s automatic placement on Academic Conditional Status: 
i. A graduate student’s grade point average for any term is less than 3.0, calculated on all of the letter graded upper division and graduate courses completed while registered as a graduate student at the University of California. ii. A graduate student’s cumulative grade point average is less than 3.0, calculated on all of the letter graded upper division and graduate courses completed while registered as a graduate student at the University of California. iii. A graduate student earns a grade of B- or less in a course. iv. A graduate student accumulates a combination of more than eight units of “I,” “U” and/or “F” grades in total. b. Events that May Lead to Academic Conditional Status at the Discretion of the Associate Dean: 
i. Graduate students with this status will be notified by the appropriate faculty and administrators for their degree granting unit (e.g. Associate Dean, Graduate Advisor, Thesis Advisor, and/or Chair, etc.) that they are not making satisfactory progress in their research or coursework (e.g. failing a comprehensive/prelim exam, not advancing to candidacy, not passing a language requirement, or other program requirements). ii. Graduate students who are beyond the maximum time to degree for their respective program. 
48 
Updated 1/17/19 
5. Procedure for Notifying Graduate Students of Placement on Academic Conditional Status. When graduate students are placed on Academic Conditional Status, the Associate Dean of their School shall send each graduate student a letter informing the student that he/she is on Academic Conditional Status and indicating the requirements for returning to good academic standing and a specific timeline for doing so. Details of what is required will be specific to the program and the individual student’s progress. 
6. Grounds for Disqualification 
a. Automatic Disqualification from Further Registration. A graduate student is automatically disqualified from further registration if, at the end of any term, the graduate student’s grade point average for that term is less than 2.0. b. When Academic Conditional Status Leads to Disqualification from Further Registration. A graduate student who has been placed on Academic Conditional Status is subject to disqualification if any one or more of the following events occur: 
i. A graduate student has completed two consecutive terms on Academic Conditional Status; for instances where the condition of returning to satisfactory academic progress is to repeat, or take for the first time, a course that is offered during a time that exceeds two consecutive terms, exceptions may be made and notified to the Graduate Dean ii. During a graduate student’s term on Academic Conditional Status, the graduate student fails to improve his/her grade point average as stipulated in the Associate Dean’s warning letter. iii. If after one term on Academic Conditional Status because of an excessive number of units of combined “I,” “U” and/or “F” grades, the graduate student fails to make up the required number of such units stipulated in the Associate Dean’s warning letter or accumulates further units of “I,” “U” and/or “F” grades, disqualification will result. c. Disqualification from Further Registration upon Recommendation of the Associate Dean. 
i. General Rule. The Graduate Advisor may also recommend to the Associate Dean and appropriate faculty and administrators for that degree granting unit (e.g. Chair, Thesis Advisor, etc.) the disqualification of a graduate student who is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree objective even if the graduate student’s grade point average is above 3.0. ii. Grounds for Recommending Disqualification based on Unsatisfactory Progress. Unsatisfactory progress may result from failure of a program’s preliminary or comprehensive examination, failure to meet published timelines for completion of the degree, failure to meet deadlines imposed on the individual graduate student, or failure to make adequate progress in research or creative work. Unsatisfactory progress will also result when a Ph.D. student is unable to secure a faculty advisor or if the student’s advisor/advisee relationship is terminated and the student is unable to secure a new faculty advisor within a specified period of time. iii. Notification to Student. If the Graduate Advisor determines that a graduate student is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree objective, a letter will be sent to the graduate student informing him/her of the lack of satisfactory progress. This letter will be drafted by the Graduate Advisor in consultation with the appropriate faculty and administrators for that degree granting unit (e.g. Chair, Thesis Advisor, etc.) and ultimately approved by the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. The School will provide a copy to the Graduate Dean. 
49 
Updated 1/17/19 
iv. Opportunity to Cure. Once the graduate student has received formal written notice, the graduate student should be given at least one quarter, if practicable, to remedy the lack of progress identified in the Graduate Advisor’s report. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the graduate student will not have an opportunity to cure if the reason for the disqualification recommendation is one of the following: 1. The graduate student fails a program examination beyond the number 
of attempts the program allows for 2. A MAT or Credential student is dismissed from a student-teaching placement. 
Section III. Detailed Disqualification and Appeal Procedures 
A. Authority. Regulation 904 of the Academic Senate of the University of California reads as follows: “Disqualification of graduate students is at the discretion of the Dean of the Graduate Division concerned.” With the advice of the Graduate Council, the Graduate Dean has adopted the following policies and procedures. 
B. Procedures for Disqualification 
1. Recommendation for Disqualification by Associate Dean. If a graduate student’s Graduate Advisor determines that a graduate student is making unsatisfactory academic progress as determined by any of the factors noted in Section II of this policy, a letter will be sent to the graduate student informing her/him of the lack of satisfactory progress. This letter will be drafted by the Graduate Advisor in consultation with the appropriate faculty and administrators for that degree granting unit (e.g. Chair, Thesis Advisor, etc.) and ultimately approved by the Associate Dean. The School will provide a copy to the Graduate Dean. 
2. Graduate Dean’s Notice to Student: If the Associate Dean recommends in writing to the Graduate Dean that a graduate student be disqualified, the Graduate Dean, the administrative officer with final responsibility for disqualification, will inform the student in writing via an email to the student’s UCI email account, of receipt of the recommendation to disqualify. 
3. Graduate Student’s Right to Present Case. As a component of the notice to the student and contained in the same written communication, the graduate student shall have the right to present his or her case to the Graduate Dean in writing within 14 calendar days of the date of the Notice. The notice shall state that the Graduate Dean’s review will commence after the 14-day period has elapsed. 
4. The Graduate Dean Review: After the 14 day period, whether or not the student submits a case in writing to the Graduate Dean, the Graduate Dean will carefully review the graduate student's academic record and all materials related to the student’s academic progress, as well as any information that may be provided by the student. 
5. Notification of Decision by Graduate Dean. Unless there are indications of procedural error or other substantive mitigating factors to explain the student's unsatisfactory record, the Graduate Dean will notify the student in writing of the intent to disqualify. 
50 
Updated 1/17/19 
The Notification of Decision will state that the student has 30 calendar days from the date of the Notification of Decision to appeal the Graduate Dean’s decision. If the graduate student does not respond or withdraw from his or her respective graduate program within 30 calendar days of the Graduate Dean’s notification of intent to disqualify, the Graduate Dean shall send a final written notice of academic disqualification to the graduate student. There will be a notation placed on the student’s transcript stating that the student was academically disqualified. A graduate student who has been disqualified will not be allowed to register in any graduate program at the University of California, Irvine including the original graduate program or any other graduate program, without approval of the academic unit and the Graduate Dean. 
6. Graduate Student's Right to Appeal. The graduate student shall have the right to appeal his or her case. If the graduate student wishes to appeal the Graduate Dean’s decision, the graduate student must request an appeal in writing within the 30 calendar- day period. The student’s written appeal must be sent to the Graduate Dean, and the Graduate Dean will forward the appeal to the Graduate Council for review. 
Once the graduate student has submitted an appeal, should the graduate student choose to withdraw before a decision is reached, the appeal process stops, and the appeal becomes void. The option to withdraw terminates on the date that the Graduate Dean sends the Final Determination Notice to the graduate student. 
7. Grounds for Considering Graduate Student’s Appeal. Student appeals will be considered only if based upon specific criteria as follows: (1) procedural error; (2) verifiable evidence of personal bias; or (3) judgments based on non-academic criteria1. Disagreements over evaluation of academic quality are not an appropriate basis for an appeal. 
8. Graduate Student’s Status during Appeal Period. 
While the appeal is being considered, the student has two options. A) The student can withdraw from the program, which results in a “W” on the student’s transcript, rather than a disqualification notation. This option to withdraw terminates on the date that the Graduate Dean sends the Final Determination Notice to the graduate student. B) The student must maintain his or her registration status, if eligible to do so, based on grade point average and other requirements. In either case, if during the appeal process the student’s status lapses (i.e., the student fails to, or is ineligible to, register), the disqualification and appeal process will terminate. 
The Graduate Council will assign the case to their subcommittee on academic disqualification which will review the appeal, collect additional material if necessary and make a recommendation to Graduate Council. Graduate Council will then vote on a decision. The recommendation and vote will be conducted with only voting members present as well as the Graduate Council Analyst who serves as the record keeper for the Council minutes. The Graduate Council’s decision will be implemented by the Graduate Division Dean who will notify the student and all relevant parties involved. The Graduate 
1 Complaints relating to discrimination on the basis of any protected status by law or UC Policy shall be referred to the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (“OEOD”), and the matter will be held in abeyance until OEOD has completed its investigation. OEOD shall report its findings to the Graduate Dean. 
51 
Updated 1/17/19 
Dean shall formally communicate the final decision to the student, and all parties involved, in writing. 
9. Final Determination Notice. Upon receipt of the Graduate Council’s decision in writing as to the disposition of the case, the Graduate Dean shall formally communicate the final decision to the student in writing. The Graduate Dean’s final notice to the student will include: (1) the basis for the decision; (2) its effective date; and (3) the nature of the recommendations of the Graduate Council. For students seeking J.D. or M.D. degrees, the disqualification and appeals process will be according to the written procedures adopted by the Schools of Law and Medicine, respectively. 
C. Due Process Requirements. To ensure that a decision to disqualify a graduate student from an academic program is just, the following due process requirements must be met: 
1. Departmental and program policies must be clearly stated in writing, and a copy provided to all graduate students in the program upon acceptance into the graduate program or within the first few weeks of the graduate student's first quarter of enrollment in classes. 
2. Information on University and campus policies affecting graduate students must be provided to all graduate students in the program. Most of these can be found on the UCI Website and the UCI General Catalogue. 
3. Academic standards must be uniformly applied. 
4. Modification of a graduate program's policies undertaken to improve its offerings or to exercise its educational responsibilities must be submitted to the Graduate Council for approval in accordance with Academic Senate policy. 
5. Graduate students must be promptly informed of any such modifications as described above, and should be allowed, whenever appropriate and feasible, to complete work under standards in place at the time of their initial enrollment in the program. Academic units should contact the Graduate Division Student Affairs Officer to determine the appropriateness of requiring enrolled graduate students to meet new standards. 
6. Grades must accurately reflect a graduate student's performance in each course, including research units. 
7. An attempt must be made to discover if a graduate student lacks the academic qualifications to complete a graduate degree program as early as possible in the graduate student's academic career. If a graduate student’s physical or mental disability is affecting their degree progress, the graduate student should be referred to the Disability Services Center. 
8. The graduate student must be given early written notice of potentially unsatisfactory academic progress and a specific period of time, if practicable, in which to correct all deficiencies. The written notice must also state the outcome should the graduate student fail to correct the deficiencies by the stated deadline(s). 
D. Appeal Timeline. The following time requirements apply to the appeals process: 
52 
Updated 1/17/19 
1. Timeframe for Graduate Student’s Appeal of Graduate Dean’s Initial Disqualification Decision. Once a graduate student receives the Notification of Decision from the Graduate Dean, the Graduate Dean shall give the graduate student 30 calendar days from the date of the Notification of Decision to appeal the decision or to withdraw from the graduate program. The graduate student must request an appeal in writing. 
2. Grounds for Appeal. If the graduate student chooses to appeal within the 30 calendar day period, the graduate student may do so only on the basis of one or more of the following specific criteria: (1) procedural error; (2) verifiable evidence of personal bias; or (3) judgments based on non-academic criteria. 
3. Process for Considering and Resolving Appeal. If a graduate student submits a timely appeal to the disqualification decision, the Graduate Dean shall forward the appeal file to the Graduate Council. The Graduate Council will assign the case to their subcommittee on academic disqualification which will review the appeal, collect additional material if necessary and make a recommendation to Graduate Council. Graduate Council will then vote on a decision. The recommendation and vote will be conducted with only voting members present as well as the Graduate Council Analyst who serves as the record keeper for the Council minutes. The Graduate Council’s decision will be implemented by the Graduate Division Dean who will notify the student and all relevant parties involved. The Graduate Dean shall formally communicate the final decision to the student, and all parties involved, in writing. 
4. Content of Final Determination Notice to Graduate Student. The Graduate Dean shall include the following information in the final disqualification notice to the student: (1) the basis for the decision; (2) its effective date; and (3) the nature of the recommendations of the Graduate Council. For students seeking J.D. or M.D. degrees, the disqualification and appeals process will be according to the written procedures adopted by the Schools of Law and Medicine, respectively. 
5. Limits on Graduate Student’s Right to Withdraw in Lieu of Disqualification. Once the graduate student has submitted an appeal, should the graduate student choose to withdraw before a decision is reached, the appeal process stops and the appeal becomes void. The option to withdraw terminates on the date that the Graduate Dean sends the Final Determination Notice to the graduate student. 
E. Procedure if Graduate Student does not Appeal. If the graduate student does not respond or withdraw from his or her respective graduate program within 30 calendar days of the Graduate Dean’s notification of intent to disqualify, the Graduate Dean shall send a final written notice of academic disqualification to the graduate student. There will be a notation placed on the student’s transcript stating that the student was academically disqualified. A graduate student who has been disqualified will not be allowed to register in any graduate program at the University of California, Irvine including the original graduate program or any other graduate program, without written approval of the admitting academic unit and the Graduate Dean. 
B. Graduate Standards for Grading 
For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship, and only coursework in which these grades are received may be applied toward degree requirements (see 2, Academic Unit Exceptions, below). If the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in 
53 
Updated 1/17/19 
all courses applicable to the degree, one UCI course in which a grade of B- is earned may be accepted by the petition process in partial satisfaction of the degree requirements. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass/Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a student whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. The minimum grade point average standards, as stated in this manual, are minimum UCI requirements. Individual academic unit faculty retains the prerogative to apply stricter standards for graduate students within their academic unit. 
1. Course Repetition 
Courses in which a grade below a B, or a grade of U, was received may be repeated only once. Only the most recently earned grades will be used in computing the student’s grade point average for the first eight (8) units of repeated graduate coursework. Thereafter, both the earlier and later grades are averaged. 
2. Academic Unit Exceptions 
In the case of those graduate programs in which the faculty has adopted, and the Graduate Council has approved, a special grading standard, courses in which the grade of B-, C+, and C were assigned will be accepted in partial satisfaction of degree requirements. Such exceptions must be noted in the Graduate Degree Program Summary for that program. A copy of the program summary is available in the academic unit and in the Graduate Division (contact the Enrolled Student Affairs Officer). Please note that a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 is required for all degree awards. 
3. Individual Exceptions 
With the approval of a student's Graduate Faculty Advisor and the Graduate Dean, a course in which the student received a grade of C+ or C may be accepted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for an advanced degree. Such exceptions are rarely granted. Whenever possible, the student should repeat the course for satisfactory credit toward the degree. 
4. Pass/Not Pass (P/NP) 
The grade Pass (P) is applied to undergraduate coursework only. It is equivalent to C level work or better, and does not represent satisfactory scholarship for a graduate student. The grade P is not considered as meeting the academic criteria for satisfactory progress, for university- administered fellowships, or for academic appointments/employment. If a graduate student chooses the option of P/NP grading, it is assumed that the course is an elective that does not have any significant relationship to the student's progress in the graduate program. A graduate student may elect P/NP grading for one course only (a maximum of 4 units) per quarter. Under no circumstances will courses taken P/NP count toward unit and degree requirements for any graduate degree program. 
5. Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) 
A grade of Satisfactory (S) is equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of Unsatisfactory (U) was assigned. 
54 
Updated 1/17/19 
A student cannot self-elect S/U grading. The S/U grading is assigned by the instructor and may be assigned to all participants in a graduate course with the approval of the Graduate Council in accordance with Academic Senate regulations. Similarly, with the consent of the academic unit involved and approval by the Graduate Council, individual study and research or other individual graduate work may be evaluated by means of the grades Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory. 
6. In Progress (IP) 
"In Progress" is a transcript notation restricted to sequential courses extending over two or more quarters, and for which use of the IP notation has been approved by the Graduate Council and the academic unit. It indicates satisfactory progress, and should not be assigned if the level or the progress of the work to date is not satisfactory. Upon completion of the last quarter of the course sequence, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No course credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. 
If a student who was assigned the provisional notation IP for one or several quarters of a course sequence fails to complete the sequence, the instructor may assign a final grade and request the Registrar to replace the IP with that final grade on the permanent record. In the event that no action is taken to replace the IP with a final grade, the IP will be changed to an Incomplete (I) -- see below -- at the end of the third quarter following the quarter in which it was originally assigned, or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. Only quarters in which a student is enrolled will be counted in determining the time at which an IP is changed to an I. 
7. Incomplete (I) 
The grade Incomplete (I) may be assigned when a student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete for good cause. The student must make arrangements with their instructor to complete the coursework within a period of no more than 12 months following the term in which the grade Incomplete was originally awarded, or prior to the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. The instructor is not obligated to allow the maximum time period. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. 
Incomplete (I) grades will convert to a failing grade (F), not pass (NP), or unsatisfactory (U), whichever is appropriate, after remaining on the student's record for 12 months, as governed by Irvine Academic Senate Regulation IR A345. 
The number of Incomplete grades accumulated by a student should be monitored and limited carefully, and should be removed as soon as possible. Incomplete grades are an important factor in evaluating academic progress as well as in determining eligibility for employment. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is no more than 12 months following the term in which the grade Incomplete was originally awarded, but stricter limits may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade notice to the Registrar. The general procedure is to process such requests with the approval of the Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade will convert to a failing grade (F), not pass (NP), or unsatisfactory (U), whichever is appropriate and is recorded permanently. This is then used when computing GPA to determine whether the student meets the minimum GPA requirement for graduation (3.0). 
55 
Updated 1/17/19 
8. No Report (NR) 
The NR notation is made on a student's permanent record in those cases where the student's name appears on the official class roster but the instructor did not turn in a grade for the student. The NR notation is applied under extenuating circumstances only: specifically, if the student and instructor have not reached agreement on the work, or, if a student misses a final exam, and the instructor does not have a chance to talk with the student before grades are due. Under these circumstances, the instructor may not be able to give a grade based on the material the student has completed. 
A student who receives an NR transcript notation should immediately contact the instructor to arrange for the removal or replacement of the notation. The NR may be removed from the student's record by the action of the instructor providing that the assignment of the NR was due to a clerical or procedural error. Depending on the circumstances, the instructor may request that the Registrar change the NR to a grade (including the grade Incomplete), or remove the entry for that course altogether from the permanent record. 
If no action is taken to remove the NR from the permanent record after one quarter of subsequent enrollment, or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first, the NR notation will be changed to an F or NP (UCI Academic Senate Regulation A345 [G2]). 
9. Withdrawal (W) 
In accordance with UC Irvine Academic Senate Regulation 440, the Registrar will record on a student's permanent academic record a W notation for each course the student drops at any time after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's transcript will be disregarded in determining the grade point average. In general, W notations are not considered in determining a student's satisfactory progress. However, if a student accumulates a significant number of W notations, they may become a significant factor in this regard. 
C. Removal of Deficient Grades and Repeat of Courses 
Repetition of courses not authorized to be taken more than once for credit is limited by Academic Senate policy. A graduate student may repeat a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of Unsatisfactory was received one time. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the student's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work. Thereafter, both the earlier and the later grades are averaged. All credit units attempted and grades received remain part of the permanent record of the student. 
D. Examinations 
1. Scheduling of Examinations 
Ordinarily, examinations that are required for an advanced degree, including language and comprehensive examinations and qualifying or final examinations for the Ph.D. or professional doctorate degree, may be given only during an academic session for which the student has registered. However, with the approval of the graduate committee of the academic unit, such examinations may be given between the end of any academic session for which the student was registered and the beginning of the next regular academic session. 
56 
Updated 1/17/19 
2. Repeat of Critical Examinations 
In accordance with Academic Senate policy, a graduate student shall have the option of taking a second examination in the event of unsatisfactory performance on a critical examination. Included are the first-year comprehensive examination, comprehensive examination for Master's degrees, the Ph.D. qualifying examination, the Ph.D. candidacy examination, and the final examination on the Ph.D. dissertation. The second examination may have a format different from the first, but the substance should remain the same. A student whose performance on the second attempt is also unsatisfactory, or who does not undertake a second examination within a reasonable period of time, is subject to academic disqualification. A third examination may be given only with the approval of the departmental graduate committee and the Graduate Dean. 
3. Credit by Examination 
If a student thinks that his or her knowledge of the content of a given course, or knowledge of the appropriate subject matter, is sufficient to be tested by formal examination without enrollment in a course, the student may petition for a limited amount of credit by examination. The following conditions must be met before such a petition can be approved: 
• The student must be registered for at least four units of upper-division and/or graduate-level work at the time the examination is taken. 
• The student's overall scholarship must be satisfactory (3.0 or better cumulative grade point average). 
• The course itself must be one that can be tested by examination. Graduate seminars and research courses cannot be taken for credit by examination. 
In cases where the petition for credit by examination is approved, instructors retain the prerogative to: (1) decide whether they will serve as examiners; (2) determine the form such an examination may take; and (3) stipulate whether grades will be reported as Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory or as letter grades in accordance with grading policy for that course. 
The Credit by Examination Petition may be obtained from the Registrar or from the Academic Dean of the school offering the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the Dean of that school prior to the examination. The petition must also be validated at the Cashier’s Office by payment of a small fee. 
E. UCI Academic Senate Policy on Academic Honesty 
(Approved by the Irvine Division on 6/2/88, revised 12/12/96; revised 10/12/00) 
The consequences of failing to uphold the academic honesty policy is published in the UCI General Catalogue and in the UCI Academic Senate Manual. 
Students are expected to become familiar with this policy. Students who fail to uphold their fundamental academic obligation are subject to consequences that might range from lowering a grade to campus-wide sanctions, up to and including dismissal. Examples of conduct that fall under the aegis of the policy on academic honesty include, but are not limited to, plagiarism, cheating, stealing of exams, falsifying the record of their work, or collusion in such dishonest activities. When faculty suspect academic dishonesty, they need to follow due process guidelines and investigate their suspicions promptly and fairly. Minimally, due process requires that suspected students be given clear and prompt notice of the suspicion and the opportunity to confront or rebut the evidence that 
57 
Updated 1/17/19 
gave rise to the suspicion. Some procedures for implementing the policy can also be found in the UC-UCI document Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students. 
F. Individual Development Plans 
(approved by the Graduate Council 1/11/18) 
Doctoral and MFA students are required to complete annual Individual Development Plans (IDPs) in consultation with their faculty advisor. Programs may use the Graduate Division IDP template or modify the document to include additional questions relevant to the discipline. 
G. Graduate Mentoring and Advising Policy 
(Revised version approved by the Graduate Council 4/13/17) 
Introduction 
A mentor-mentee relationship is based on trust and discretion. Good mentoring involves treating students respectfully and fairly providing reliable guidance, and serving as a role model for upholding the highest ethical standards. The Graduate Council recognizes that faculty mentoring of graduate students, both academic and professional, is a necessary and integral part of the graduate experience. There is a distinction to make between being a mentor and being an advisor—a mentor is someone who is attentive to the professional future of the student, while an advisor is someone who directs the student on what steps are needed to graduate. Both, however, exhibit characteristics that span beyond formal classroom instruction and can be found in one individual together or distributed across multiple supporters. In this document, the term “Graduate Advisor” will be used to reference the faculty member charged by an academic unit with directing a graduate program. Each graduate program has at least one Graduate Advisor. The term “Faculty Advisor” will be used to reference an individual student’s thesis chair, dissertation chair, or capstone project advisor. It is common for the faculty advisor to also serve as a student’s mentor. In this case, the faculty advisor shares wisdom, technical knowledge, guidance, and support that helps students understand how to succeed in their graduate program, excel in their field of study, and to recognize and choose among career options. Some departments may enhance mentoring beyond the role of the faculty advisor through incorporating peer mentoring, professional development workshops, and other activities. While it is necessary to have one primary faculty advisor, contemporary views of mentoring suggest that multiple mentors may be beneficial to mentees’ study, reading, research, writing and career development. 
Because disciplines and programs face their own unique challenges, we recommend that each graduate program define their own best practices in terms of mentoring and develop their own set of guidelines for both faculty and graduate students. Understanding that both the mentor and mentee play an active role in this relationship is a vital first step; both should be aware of the following guiding principles regarding this relationship: 
• Mentors and students should discuss and come to a clear understanding of their expectations, clearly defining roles and responsibilities. 
• Either party has the right to terminate the mentoring relationship if not seen as satisfactory, despite genuine attempts at conflict resolution. However, departments may require students to have a primary faculty advisor at all times to remain in the program. 
• The relationship should enable shared decision-making regarding the mentee’s professional development, incorporating both individuals’ points of view. 
• Meetings should be held in an appropriate environment where both parties feel they can speak freely. 
58 
Updated 1/17/19 
• Commitments made should be honored. Both parties should be considerate of each other’s time and provide as much notice as possible when cancelling or rescheduling meetings. 
• Information shared in mentoring meetings is subject to standard rules of professional confidence. 
Role of Faculty 
Regardless of the program or department-specific model, it is expected that each student receives advising and mentoring. It is the responsibility of each graduate program’s faculty to advise and monitor the academic progress while encouraging the professional development of each student. Faculty should be attentive to the future of their students and serve as advocates on their behalf when appropriate. Guidelines for advising and mentoring are provided below. 
Advising 
• In coordination with program staff, faculty advisors guide students through degree requirements by providing a clear map from the very beginning. This includes defining a timeline for completing coursework requirements and qualifying examinations. 
• Faculty advisors assist students through the thesis and/or dissertation process. This includes providing advice on timely initiation and completion, topic choice, acquiring sources of funding, committee formation, etc. 
• Faculty advisors clearly evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their student’s research and ensure that the grades assigned for independent study are consistent with the student’s performance. 
• Faculty advisors provide regular and timely feedback on the progress of students, including constructive criticism on progress. Individual Development Plans (IDP) can be used as a tool to help facilitate these discussions. 
• Faculty advisors must meet quarterly with students not making satisfactory progress to evaluate their progress. 
• Faculty advisors foster the development of communication skills, written and oral, as it pertains to the students’ particular area of study. 
Mentoring 
• Mentors provide constructive advice and guide the professional development of students. 
• Mentors affirm students’ pursuit of health and wellness, as well as professional skills beyond research which are necessary to career success. 
• Mentors encourage students’ participation in appropriate professional meetings of national and regional groups and societies. 
• Mentors share their resources and networks, as appropriate, to facilitate interaction with other scholars, both on campus and in the wider professional community. 
• Mentors assist with applications for research funding, fellowship applications, and other applications specific to the program or discipline. 
• Mentors provide career guidance, assistance in the preparation of a CV and/or resume, coaching for job interviews, and writing letters of recommendation in a timely manner. 
• Mentors direct graduate students to various career resources available at the Graduate Resource Center (GRC) and UCI Career Center (workshops, career fairs, etc.) 
• Mentors recognize that there are a variety of career options available to their students and encourage students to explore multiple career paths. 
59 
Updated 1/17/19 
Role of Graduate Students 
It is essential that graduate students see themselves as partners in the mentoring relationship. As mentees, graduate students should: 
• Be aware of their own mentoring needs and how they can change through their graduate tenure. Changes should be discussed with their faculty advisor and/or mentor in a timely manner. 
• Proactively seek out mentorship; be aware of advertised workshops and resources. Keep in mind that one faculty advisor may not be able to satisfy all needs. 
• Recognize that their mentoring needs must respect their mentor’s other responsibilities and time commitments. 
• Be aware of, and meet, the deadlines associated with the degree program and develop a plan to accommodate to them. 
• Maintain and seek regular communication with their mentor(s), especially their primary faculty advisor. 
• Each graduate student must establish an advisee/advisor relationship and formally secure a faculty advisor by the time of their advancement to candidacy. 
Role of the University 
• New faculty orientations should include a discussion of the importance of graduate student mentoring. 
Role of the Program/Academic Unit 
• Graduate programs must assign an initial graduate advisor to each graduate student at the time of first enrollment. For doctoral students, the graduate advisor must be a faculty member. For master’s students, the graduate advisor may be a faculty member or staff member. 
• Annual reviews must be conducted for every graduate student. Students should be provided with timely written feedback following this annual review. 
• Share information concerning program-specific mentoring policies with all faculty. 
• Academic units should be encouraged to provide training on implicit bias, mentoring, and conflict resolution as appropriate for their faculty, staff, and students. 
Best Practices to Consider for Programs/Academic Units 
• Develop a program mission statement that establishes mentoring as a core component of the graduate student experience. 
• Read and become familiar with Graduate Policies and Procedures so that the criteria for monitoring satisfactory progress is clear. 
• Hold an orientation for all new graduate students, where program requirements, including normative and maximum time-to-degree, are clearly outlined and provided in writing. 
• Provide graduate students with a program handbook. 
• Create multiple mechanisms for faculty mentoring such as faculty-graduate student lunches, rotating faculty mentors within a graduate program, and increasing opportunities for enhancing professional socialization. 
• Effective peer-to peer and near-peer mentoring can complement faculty mentoring. Faculty guidance for such programs enhances effectiveness. 
60 
Updated 1/17/19 
Principles for Programs/Academic Units 
• Remember that all faculty share responsibility for graduate student mentoring. 
• Positively reinforce good mentoring practices with rewards and incentives. 
• Keep an open mind and show respect for the individuality of students and their different needs and goals. 
• Respect students’ family responsibilities and be cognizant of students who may need extra support when having a child, raising a child alone, returning to school after child-rearing, carrying for an elderly parent, etc. 
These guidelines were developed using the following document: Mentoring Guidelines, Graduate Council, University of California, Merced Division 
VII. STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS 
Students must satisfy the degree requirements outlined in the General Catalogue that are in effect at the time they first enroll in a graduate program. If the degree requirements are subsequently revised, the academic unit may, where appropriate, give students the option to meet the new requirements. A student who withdraws from a program, or loses student status for other reasons for more than three quarters, will be bound by the degree requirements in effect at the time of readmission unless otherwise stipulated and agreed to in writing by the academic unit and approved by the Graduate Dean; students are also required to re-advance to candidacy. A student who defers admission or who changes to another program must meet the requirements in effect at the time of first registration. 
Most requirements for graduate degree programs are determined by the academic unit that offers the degree. However, the Graduate Council, on behalf of the Academic Senate, has approval authority over all graduate programs (with the exception of the M.D. and J.D. degrees) on the Irvine campus. In addition, the Office of Academic Affairs at UCI, the UC-wide Coordinating Committee of Graduate Affairs, the Office of the President, and the Committee on Post-Secondary Education are also involved in setting standards, reviewing, and approving new graduate programs on the UC campuses. 
A. Second Advanced Degrees 
The University of California discourages the duplication of advanced degrees. At the same time, it recognizes that a professional degree does not duplicate an academic one, and that the holders of either an academic or professional degree may have the pressing need to earn another degree in an area different from that of their first endeavors. 
If admitted for a second graduate degree, students will be held to all the usual degree requirements and University regulations pertaining to fees, examinations, advancement to candidacy, residency, etc. Courses already applied to any previously earned graduate degree cannot be applied toward the requirements of the second degree. 
1. Second Master's Degree 
In accordance with the policy approved by the Graduate Council, the Graduate Dean has delegated the authority to admit students for a second Master's degree in an unrelated discipline to the academic units. If a program wishes to admit a student for a second Master’s degree in the same discipline or a related field, the program must request an exception. These requests must be 
61 
Updated 1/17/19 
made in writing to the Graduate Dean and should include strong justification for admitting the applicant for a second Master’s degree in the same discipline or a related field, as well as a statement assuring the Dean that there will be no duplication, transfer, or waiving of coursework. 
[Example: If a student with an MS in Civil Engineering applied to UCI for an MS in Environmental Engineering, it would require an exception to admit them. However, if the same student with an MS in Civil Engineering applied to UCI for an MA in History, this would not require an exception.] 
2. Second Ph.D. 
Admission for a second Ph.D. is rarely granted, and must be handled as an exception to policy and approved by the Graduate Dean. All requests must be made in writing to the Graduate Dean and should include strong justification for admitting the applicant for a second Ph.D., as well as a statement assuring the Dean that the applicant's first Ph.D. is in an unrelated area and that there will be no duplication, transfer, or waiving of coursework. 
B. Language Requirements 
Completion of language or alternate skill requirements, if part of the graduate program, may occur any time prior to completion of all other degree requirements unless otherwise specified by the program. However, it is preferable that they be satisfactorily completed before a student advances to candidacy. The graduate program may decide how the examinations are to be given. The Graduate Division must be advised in writing of the type of test taken and the date passed. If an alternate skill requirement approved by the Graduate Council in lieu of a foreign language is satisfied, this should also be indicated in writing. 
C. Academic Advisement and Evaluation 
Graduate programs must establish well-defined criteria for completion of degree requirements and must keep students updated on all changes to rules, policies, and procedures. Departments must prepare a written document of the requirements and distribute it to all graduate students. For first year graduate students, formal evaluation should occur at the end of their first and third quarters of attendance. Continuing evaluation is required at least annually thereafter. This provides encouragement and support to those students making acceptable progress and, most importantly, may avert potential problems with students who are not maintaining satisfactory progress toward their degree. 
While each academic unit is encouraged to develop its own process of student evaluation and advisement, it is generally accepted that certain elements are essential: 
• Within the context of each course in which the student enrolls, an evaluation of the student's performance by the instructor. 
• For those students engaged in research activities, frequent evaluation and advising on an informal basis by the supervising member of the faculty. 
• Continuing supervision of dissertation work by the primary faculty advisor with progress evaluated and discussed with the student on at least a quarterly basis. 
62 
Updated 1/17/19 
• An overall evaluation of each student's academic progress that is conveyed to and discussed with the student, preferably each quarter, but at least once each academic year. An annual evaluation ordinarily is the joint responsibility of the Departmental Faculty Advisor and the assigned Faculty Advisor or the Chair of the student's graduate committee, where applicable. An evaluation must: (1) include a brief review of the student's work to date, with particular attention to the period since the last report; (2) describe the student's progress toward the degree; (3) identify any areas in which improvement is recommended or required; and (4) establish academic objectives for the following period. 
• Identification of a departmental representative whom the student may consult as a disinterested party. 
Each student should also have an advisory committee established by the graduate program that will be responsible for the guidance of that student in the course of his or her period of study. The committee may choose to inform the student in writing of his or her academic progress more than once per year, and the student may also request additional written evaluations. A copy of this correspondence must be kept in the academic unit files, with another copy forwarded to the Graduate Dean via the Enrolled Student Affairs Officer. 
D. Written Expectations for Research Units and Individual Development Plans 
(approved by the Graduate Council 1/11/18) 
Programs are required to provide a form of written expectations or a syllabus for master’s and doctoral students enrolled in graduate research units. Expectations should be devised by individual programs. 
Doctoral and MFA students are required to complete annual Individual Development Plans (IDPs) in consultation with their faculty advisor. Programs may use the Graduate Division IDP template or modify the document to include additional questions relevant to the discipline. 
E. Language Policy for Examinations and Theses/Dissertations 
English is to be the language of instruction and examination for graduate courses at UCI, unless the subject matter includes foreign language content. Similarly, examinations that satisfy specific degree requirements, such as qualifying/candidacy examinations and thesis/dissertation defenses will be conducted in English, except for the portions of the examination where the subject matter makes a different language specifically appropriate. 
Students must seek permission to write their thesis/dissertation in a language other than English. To do so, immediately after advancement to candidacy, the candidate must submit a letter to the Graduate Dean, approved by the thesis/dissertation chair, committee, and department chair. All members of the candidate’s thesis/dissertation committee must have a reading knowledge of the language presented in the thesis/dissertation. There must be legitimate reasons for substituting English with a foreign language such as subject matter, special primary audience, publication arrangements, academic position in a foreign country, historical or literary value, or principal language(s) used in the documents to be analyzed and interpreted. Inability to write in English is not a valid reason. If the thesis or dissertation is approved to be written in a foreign language, the candidate must submit two abstracts. One must be in English. The other must be written in the language of the thesis or dissertation. Moreover, the thesis/dissertation defense will be conducted in English, except as determined by subject matter. See the UCI Thesis and Dissertation Manual for information about the preparation of manuscripts.

Updated 1/17/19 
F. Conflict of Interest (Approved by the Irvine Division on 5/11/00) 
1. Definition 
For the purposes of this document the term "conflict of interest" refers to instances where faculty may have a financial conflict of interest as defined in Section 028 of the Academic Personnel Manual (APM), adopted April 26, 1984, and in APM 025/50. Information on this and other types of conflicts of interest or on student grievance procedures are described on the UCI Office of Research website and in the University of California publication entitled Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students. The complete Academic Senate Policy on Conflict of Interest and Graduate Education is published in the UCI Academic Senate Manual. 
2. Objective 
The policy on financial conflict of interest establishes mechanisms to protect the academic interests of a graduate student in the event that a faculty mentor, thesis or dissertation advisor or member of a student’s committee may have a conflict of interest relating to a project on which the student may be working. Such a conflict of interest may result from the faculty member having a financial interest in a project on which the student is working, whether sponsored or unsponsored. The intent is to apply the policy only to those situations in which a financial conflict of interest is perceived to be potentially harmful to the academic interests of the student. The graduate student, the faculty mentor/advisor, a departmental representative (either the graduate advisor or chair), or the campus Conflict of Interest Oversight Committee can initiate the procedures to deal with the perceived conflict of interest. The procedures must also be considered in conjunction with the Academic Senate-Irvine Division regulations governing the doctoral committee and the candidacy committee. 
3. Summary of Mechanism 
When a graduate student, the faculty mentor/advisor, graduate advisor, departmental chair, or the campus Conflict of Interest Oversight Committee (COIOC) identifies a conflict of interest, a departmental representative should be notified in writing. The departmental representative, who may be the Departmental Faculty Graduate Advisor or department chair, will then examine the potential impact upon the student. If there is a potential for harm to the student, then an additional faculty member, termed the “Oversight Member”, will be appointed, by the Graduate Dean, to the student's advisory and/or master's/doctoral committee to insure the faculty conflict does not impact upon the academic interests of the student. 
4. The Graduate Division 
The Graduate Division provides written information on conflict of interest policies and procedures to all academic units and students on the Ph.D. Form I Advancement to Candidacy document and on the Advancement to Candidacy and Final Report form for master's students. The information on the document includes: the definition of conflict of interest as it pertains to graduate education; a description of the nature of potential conflicts of interest and brief examples; describes the possible harmful effects on the academic interests of the graduate students; provides a list of University resources that can be consulted, and includes a statement to be signed by the department chair, departmental graduate faculty advisor, and the graduate student to acknowledge their awareness of the conflict of interest issue. At any time, the student 
64 
Updated 1/17/19 
can also seek the advice of one of the identified campus-wide resource persons, who include the Graduate Dean, the Associate Graduate Dean, the Conflict of Interest Administrator in the Office of Research at (949) 824-0012, or the UCI Ombudsman (Multipurpose Science Technology Building 205 MSTB). 
Oversight Member: If the Chair, Research/Thesis Advisor or other member of the committee has a financial interest in an outside entity that carries the possibility of a conflict of interest that is potentially harmful to the graduate student, an Oversight Member must be appointed in addition to the general members of the respective committee. 
Role of the Oversight Member: The Oversight Member shall participate on all student research advisory and/or thesis committees. An additional role of the Oversight Member is to be fully cognizant of the issues related to the possible conflict of interest and its potential impact on the student, and to be fully cognizant of the UCI resources available should a conflict of interest problem arise. Appointment of an Oversight Member: The Graduate Dean shall select the Oversight Member from a list of three nominees agreed upon by the student, the faculty research/thesis advisor, and the departmental representative. The departmental representative shall submit a written request to appoint an Oversight Member to the Graduate Dean no less than two weeks prior to the date of the exam to allow a reasonable time for review. This request should include background information describing the circumstances of the possible conflict. The Graduate Dean will retain sole authority to appoint the Oversight Member. No exceptions to this requirement will be considered. 
Note: Areas of assigned responsibility are further defined in the UCI Academic Senate policy statement dated May 11, 2000 and entitled "Policy and Procedures for Implementation of Academic Senate Policy on Conflict of Interest and Graduate Education.” 
1. Conflict of Interest Wherein a Student is Conflicted 
It is possible there may be instances where a student may be the conflicted party. These would include instances involving a student who holds a financial interest in an outside entity that may have an interest in a project on which the student is or may be working toward a graduate degree. In such cases it is important to consult with the campus Conflict of Interest Oversight Committee or the Graduate Dean. 
G. Committee Membership Appointment Procedures 
The qualifications of all committee members must be evaluated and approved by the academic unit* Chair or designee. When the membership of the proposed committee conforms to Senate policy as defined in this regulation, the Graduate Dean, on behalf of the Graduate Council, may delegate to the academic unit the authority to appoint, evaluate, and approve the committee. When the proposed membership deviates from this policy, as in the case of non-voting Senate members, faculty holding professorial titles at other Universities or non-Senate faculty with equivalent scholarly standing, or when appointment of an Oversight Member is perceived to be necessary, a request for an exception or nomination must be submitted in writing to the Graduate Dean. 
*NOTE: Definitions of Academic Unit a) Department. b) If "a" fails, Interdisciplinary Program. 
65 
Updated 1/17/19 
c) If "a" and "b" fail, the graduate program which oversees the student’s progress. d) If “a”, “b” and “c” fail, the School. In cases where multicampus programs are involved, the same definitions will apply across all campuses relevant to the program. 
Non-voting Senate members, faculty holding professorial titles at other Universities or non- Senate faculty with equivalent scholarly standing will be considered on an exception-only basis. The Dean of Graduate Division retains sole authority to grant these exceptions, which must be submitted in writing by the Chair of the academic unit at least two weeks prior to the scheduled exam, and must be accompanied by a curriculum vitae of the individual for whom the exception is being requested. A list of the faculty holding primary or joint appointments with the student's department or academic unit may be required by the Dean of Graduate Division. 
Duties and Responsibilities 
It is the responsibility of the Chair of the academic unit, the Departmental Faculty Advisor, Mentor or Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs as appropriate, and the Chair of the Thesis, Candidacy or Doctoral Committee to: 
1) Inform the student regarding the policy on Thesis, Candidacy or Doctoral Committees -- 
including full disclosure of issues pertaining to possible conflict of interest that is potentially harmful to the student; 
2) to provide graduate students with a policy statement on such possible conflict of interest prior to 
the student designating a research topic, forming a graduate committee, or being employed as a research or teaching assistant, whichever comes first; and 
3) Ensure that the Academic Senate policies are followed. In the case of a doctoral student 
advancing to candidacy, should these Senate policies not be followed the student will be required to retake the Qualifying Exam. 
Membership 
a. Master’s Thesis Committee Plan I (See IR 830, amended March 2010) 
The Master's Thesis Committee is comprised of three voting members of the University of California Academic Senate -- not necessarily the Irvine Division -- or by equivalent scholarly standing, by exception. A majority of the committee, but not necessarily all, shall be affiliated with the program. 
Chair: The Chair of the committee shall always hold a primary or joint academic appointment in the academic unit/program (see above for Definitions of Academic Unit) supervising the master's program and must be a voting member of the UC Academic Senate; no exceptions will be granted for this position. 
General Members: Non-voting Senate members; faculty members from other universities; or non- Senate faculty with equivalent scholarly standing will be considered for general membership on the committee on an exception basis only. Academic Senate members from UC’s other than the Irvine Division do not require an exception; however, a CV is required for verification. 
Oversight Member: See Conflict of Interest (Section 4). 
66 
Updated 1/17/19 
b. Candidacy Committee – Regulation 918 
The Candidacy Committee is comprised of five faculty who are voting members of the University of California Academic Senate or by equivalent scholarly standing, by exception. Candidacy committee members need not necessarily be from the Irvine Division, but a majority and not all must hold primary or joint appointments in the student’s department. If the student is not affiliated with an individual department, a majority of the committee must hold either primary or joint appointments with the academic unit granting the doctoral degree. 
The Chair: The Chair of the Candidacy Committee must hold either a primary or joint appointment in the student’s department (or academic unit) and must be a voting member of the UC Academic Senate. No exceptions to these requirements will be considered. 
General Membership: At least two members in addition to the Chair must hold either a primary or joint appointment in the student’s department or academic unit. No exceptions to the requirement that a majority of voting members hold appointments in the student’s department or academic unit will be considered. Non-voting Senate members; faculty members from other universities; or non- Senate faculty with equivalent scholarly standing will be considered for general membership on an exception-only basis. Academic Senate members from UC’s other than the Irvine Division do not require an exception, however, a curriculum vitae is required for verification. 
The Outside Member: One member of the Candidacy Committee, designated the "outside member," must be from the Irvine Division and may not hold either a primary or joint appointment in the student's department or academic unit. The outside member represents the faculty at large. The role of the “outside member” is to serve as an unbiased and independent judge of both the quality and fairness of the exam. It is therefore desirable that this individual be familiar with the student’s research field. No exceptions to these requirements will be considered. 
The Oversight Member: See Conflict of Interest (Section 4).

3) Oversight Member: See Conflict of Interest (Section 4). 
H. The Master’s Degree 
1. Residency Requirement 
A minimum of three quarters in academic residence is required prior to the award of most master's degrees, including the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) and the Master of Advanced Study (MAS) degrees. Six quarters in academic residence are required for the Master of Fine Arts degree programs (with the exception of Drama, which requires nine quarters) and the M.B.A. programs in the School of Business. A minimum period of study of one quarter in- residence must intervene between formal advancement to candidacy and the conferring of the Master's degree (SR 682). 
2. Curricular Requirements 
The requirements listed herein are the minimum required by the University of California. Most master's degree programs require additional work. Detailed information on specific degree requirements can be found in the UCI General Catalogue, and on individual department websites. Students are responsible for fulfilling requirements in effect the year in which they are admitted. If an academic program changes degree requirements, under certain circumstances, the student, with the approval of the faculty advisor and school's associate dean for graduate affairs, may opt to accept the new requirements 
The following regulations of the Academic Senate, Irvine Division, apply to curricular requirements for students in Master's programs. 
a. Coursework Requirements and Thesis and Examination Options (Irvine Regulations [IR] 805/810/830/835) 1) (IR) 805 Master's Degree Options The master's degree is attained by: Plan I, the Thesis option, or Plan II, the Comprehensive Examination option. A program may offer the option of one or both plans with the approval of the Graduate Council. Each of these plans has minimum coursework requirements, but programs may impose additional requirements. 
2) (IR) 810 Course Requirements The minimum course requirement for the master's degree is given below. This requirement may be waived or reduced only on the recommendation of the academic unit in which the degree is earned and with the approval of the Graduate Dean. 
Plan I (Thesis) 
68 
Updated 1/17/19 
In addition to the thesis, a minimum of 28 quarter units in approved courses is also required, at least 20 of which must be earned in 200 series graduate-level courses exclusive of credit given for thesis research and preparation. A general examination is also required. 
Plan II (Comprehensive Examination) In addition to the comprehensive examination, a minimum of 36 quarter units in approved courses, at least 24 of which must be from graduate-level courses in the 200 series. 
3) (IR) 830 Master's Degree Requirements: Thesis Committee: Plan I (Approved by Irvine Division May 11, 2000) 
Under Plan I a thesis is required. A committee of three faculty members recommended by the academic unit* shall approve the subject, pass on the content of the thesis, and administer the general examination. Usually the Chair of the committee directs the work. 
3. Submission of Thesis 
The submission of the thesis is the last step in the program leading to the award of an advanced degree. All theses submitted in fulfillment of requirements for advanced degrees at UCI must conform to University regulations with regard to format and method of preparation. 
Students should consult the UCI Thesis and Dissertation Manual for guidelines for writing and submitting theses/dissertations. Students are encouraged to attend the quarterly information sessions that discuss manuscript preparation and filing procedures. 
An original Master’s Final Degree Paperwork form with committee signatures and other signatures (as appropriate) must be submitted to the Graduate Division with all other final degree paperwork. The manuscript submitted electronically via ETD should not include a signature page. 
4. Deadline for Filing 
The advanced degree manuscript is expected to be submitted by the deadline in the quarter in which the degree is to be conferred. Friday of the tenth week of classes is the deadline for submitting theses and dissertations during each quarter. Those students who complete requirements and submit theses after the end of the tenth week of classes and prior to the start of the subsequent quarter will earn a degree for the following quarter, but will not be required to pay fees or enroll in units for that quarter. In such cases, to avoid payment of fees, the manuscript, all forms and degree paperwork must be submitted prior to the first day of the quarter in which the degree is to be earned. These deadlines are published on the Registrar’s website. 
5. Public Access 
In accordance with UC and UCI policy, all approved thesis/dissertation manuscripts automatically become available for public access and circulation as part of the UCI Libraries collections. The exception is if a student has requested an embargo of public access to their thesis for a period of up to six years. Students may request an exception to extend the length of this embargo by contacting the Graduate Dean. 
4) (IR) 835 Comprehensive Examination (Plan II) 
69 
Updated 1/17/19 
A final comprehensive examination, the nature of which is to be determined by the academic unit and approved by the Graduate Council, is required of candidates following Plan II. The content of the exam represents a capstone requirement that integrates the intellectual substance of the program. 
b. Advancement to Candidacy 
In accordance with University of California policy, students must be advanced to candidacy for their degree prior to the beginning of the final quarter of enrollment. An Application for Advancement to Candidacy initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit should be submitted to the Graduate Dean before (preferably 30 days before) the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Application must be accompanied by petitions for any course credits that have not already been approved by the Graduate Dean. 
Deadlines for submission and approval of the Application for Advancement to Candidacy are published each quarter. If the student has not advanced to candidacy before the beginning of the quarter in which all requirements are completed, the degree will not be conferred until the end of the following quarter. When the student is formally advanced to candidacy, the student and the academic unit are notified. 
c. Final Report for the Master’s Degree 
It is the graduate program's responsibility to insure that the course requirements of the graduate program have been met prior to submitting the Final Report for the Master's Degree to the Graduate Division. Substitutions within the graduate student program of study do not need to be approved through the Graduate Dean unless they affect minimum University and program requirements for the Master's degree. 
If the student has satisfied all requirements except for satisfactory completion of the final quarter's coursework, the department should complete the certification and return it to the Graduate Division prior to receipt of final grade reports. The Graduate Division will verify final grades with the Registrar. The department is consulted if there is any doubt about conferral of the degree. 
Students earning a master’s by Plan I, the thesis option only use the Application for Advancement to Candidacy to advance for the master’s. When the student submits the thesis either by paper submission to the Library Archives or to the Graduate Division for the electronic submission, part of the required paperwork at time of submission is the Master’s Thesis/Signature Page Report on the Final Examination for the Master’s Degree. This form requires signatures from the department as well as the thesis committee certifying completion of all requirements. 
I. Transfer of Credit 
The General Petition may be used for purposes of requesting transfer of credit by currently enrolled students only. 
1. Policy 
Transfers of credit toward master's degree requirements are governed by University regulation and policy summarized in the UCI General Catalogue. 
70 
Updated 1/17/19 
a. If official transcripts of academic work are not already in the student's file, they must be 
submitted as part of any petition for transfer credit or course substitution of degree requirements. b. No petition for transfer credit is needed for work completed as a regular graduate student in 
UCI regular academic sessions, at other campuses through Intercampus Exchange, or in UCI Summer Sessions, including Summer Sessions prior to a student’s first registered quarter following formal admission to a UCI graduate program. 2. Procedures 
a. Petitions for transfer of credit should be submitted as soon as possible after first enrollment 
as a UCI graduate student or completion of the academic work for which transfer credit is requested. All petitions for transfer credit must be supported by official transcripts of the work completed, and sent directly to the Graduate Division (Attn: Enrolled Student Affairs Officer) by the issuing institution. b. Up to one-half the total units required earned during regular academic quarters at another 
graduate division of the University of California may be transferred. c. Up to one-fifth the total units required may be transferred from any one or a combination of 
the following: University of California Extension, another institution, or Summer Sessions at another UC campus. d. Semester units will be transferred at 1.5 times the quarter unit value. e. In all cases, transfer credit may be allowed only for graduate-level work taken after 
awarding of the Bachelor's degree or when taken as an undergraduate in excess of both the unit and major requirements for the Bachelor's degree. If units were earned during undergraduate study, a letter from the institution is required stating coursework was not used towards the Bachelor’s degree. No transfer of credit will be accepted for work applied toward the requirements of another graduate degree. f. No transfer credit will be allowed for any course in which a grade below B or the equivalent 
is assigned. g. No transfer credit may be given for work completed while currently enrolled, or on an academic leave of absence, without prior written approval of the departmental faculty graduate advisor and the Graduate Dean. h. Under no circumstances will grade credits be transferred. i. Courses that are transferred do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series 
courses. 
J. The Doctoral Degree 
1. Residency Requirement 
In accordance with University of California policy, a minimum of six quarters in academic residence is required prior to awarding the Ph.D. Typically, a longer period of study, four to six years, is required for completion of all degree requirements. It is the responsibility of the academic unit to inform the student upon admission to the program of the expected degree time. If a student does not meet the departmental expected degree time, not including the first three Academic Leave of Absence quarters, a letter is sent to the student and to the department requiring that the student contact her/his Faculty Advisor and set a completion date. 
2. Teaching Requirement 
71 
Updated 1/17/19 
Most graduate programs require all graduate students pursuing the Ph.D. to acquire teaching experience at the post-secondary level under faculty supervision. This requirement is usually satisfied by appointment as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate in undergraduate courses. Refer to the section entitled Academic Appointments and Graduate Student Employment (Section IV) of this document for definitions, responsibilities, and requirements related to teaching titles. 
International and permanent resident graduate students who are not citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council, who wish to be considered for appointment as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate, must pass an approved oral English proficiency examination. 
3. Waiver of Coursework 
Courses taken toward a graduate degree at another institution cannot be transferred for credit toward a Ph.D. at UCI. However, a course requirement may be waived if a similar course was taken at another institution. The General Petition should be used for all requests for waivers of coursework. To obtain a waiver, the academic unit should submit a full description of the course including a syllabus and a copy of the student's transcripts along with the Petition to the Graduate Division for review and approval. 
4. Advancement to Candidacy 
A student advances to candidacy for the Ph.D. upon successfully demonstrating a high level of scholarship in full-time study at the Ph.D. level, and upon completing all preparatory work and demonstrating readiness to proceed to the dissertation phase. A complete description of the policy on advancement to candidacy and advancement committees is provided below. Also refer to UCI's Policy on Conflict of Interest and Graduate Education. 
a. Irvine Regulation (IR) 915 Advancement to Candidacy (Revised: Approved by Irvine 
Division May 11, 2000) 
Graduate students are nominated for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in a particular field by the academic unit responsible for advanced degrees in that field. Students are advanced to candidacy if they pass by unanimous vote an oral examination administered by a Candidacy Committee. 
Duties and Responsibilities 
The Candidacy Committee is charged with determining the fitness of the student to proceed with the doctoral dissertation through a formal Qualifying Examination. The examination should evaluate both general preparedness in the discipline, and specific competence to pursue the proposed dissertation topic. In its deliberation, the Committee ordinarily will review the student's academic record, preliminary examinations and evaluations by other faculty. The Committee may conduct any other examination it deems appropriate. The Committee ordinarily will review an outline of the proposed dissertation project, and will determine by oral examination the student's competence in that area. When, by unanimous vote, the Committee decides the student is qualified for the dissertation phase, it shall recommend advancement to candidacy to the Graduate Council via the Graduate Dean. 
72 
Updated 1/17/19 
Following its formal appointment, the Committee is free to adopt whatever procedures it deems appropriate to conduct the Qualifying Examination for candidacy, subject to the rules of the program and those specified below: 
• Administration of the Qualifying Examination must conform to the policies established by the Graduate Council. 
• The student must be given adequate notice of the content, form and time of the examination. 
• The Committee must meet to decide upon the procedures to be followed, and the student given an opportunity to comment upon the selected procedures. 
Voting Procedures 
Before voting upon its recommendation for or against candidacy, the Committee, as a whole, shall meet with the student, and any member of the Committee will have the right to pose appropriate questions to the student. If it decides to do so, the Committee may conduct part of the examination on an individual basis; e.g., the student may meet with each member in turn. However, the Committee must conclude its examination when convened with the student present. 
Conduct of the Exam 
Although the formal Qualifying Examination for candidacy ordinarily is conducted in a single day, the Committee may meet intermittently over a longer period, and may decide to reexamine the student on one or more topics after a specified interval. When the Committee meets to conduct the oral Qualifying Examination, it must report to the Graduate Council via the Graduate Dean within 30 days. The final vote and recommendation of the Committee must be unanimous and unequivocal. A recommendation that a student not be advanced is subject to conditions described herein. 
Procedure for Validating and Recording Results 
Upon completion of the Qualifying Examination, the results should be submitted to the Graduate Division on the Ph.D. Form I. The Ph.D. Form I must be signed by all committee members at the time the candidacy examination is concluded. Prior to convening a student committee for an advancement to candidacy exam, the Departmental Graduate Faculty Advisor, the department chair, and the graduate student must sign the Statement on Conflict of Interest form which is included in the Ph.D. Form I. If the unanimous recommendation of the Committee is favorable, the student must pay the Advancement to Candidacy Fee to the campus Cashier's Office that will validate the Ph.D. Form I. The student must then submit the Ph.D. Form I to the Graduate Division. The date the student submits the signed and validated form will be the official date of advancement. The candidate and graduate program will be notified of formal advancement and the appointment of a Doctoral Committee. 
5. Lapse of Candidacy 
Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A readmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. will be conferred. 
73 
Updated 1/17/19 
6. Final Examination 
If a final examination is required by the graduate program, the Doctoral Committee supervises that examination, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to the completion of the dissertation and while the student is in residence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. Administration of the final examination is subject to the policies of the Graduate Council governing critical examinations. This policy is outlined in Section VI. D. Examinations, of this document. 
Upon completion of the final examination (if required) and approval of the dissertation, the Doctoral Committee recommends, by submission of Ph.D. Form II, Signature Page/Report on Final Examination the conferral of the Ph.D. subject to final submission of the approved dissertation for deposit in Special Collections Archives for paper submission or to the Graduate Division for electronic submission. The Committee recommendation must be unanimous. 
7. Dissertation 
The submission of the dissertation is the last step in the program leading to the award of an advanced degree. All dissertations submitted in fulfillment of requirements for advanced degrees at UCI must conform to certain University regulations and specifications with regard to format and method of preparation. 
Students should consult the UCI Thesis and Dissertation Manual for guidelines for writing and submitting theses/dissertations. Students are encouraged to attend the quarterly information sessions that discuss manuscript preparation and filing procedures. 
The Doctoral Committee certifies that the completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signatures of all Committee members on the signature page of the completed dissertation. The doctoral committee chair is responsible for the content and final presentation of the manuscript. 
a. How to File Paper Submission 
After the dissertation has been approved by the committee, two copies are submitted with the appropriate forms to the Special Collections and Archives (archives@uci.edu) in the Langson Library, Room 525, who accepts it for deposit in University Archives. 
Electronic Submission 
UCI encourages Doctoral students and Master’s students to submit their dissertation or thesis electronically via the UMI ETD system. All required and optional paper forms need to be submitted to the Graduate Division, 120 Aldrich Hall. Additional information is available at the Graduate Division website. 
b. Deadline for Filing 
The advanced degree manuscript is expected to be submitted by the deadline in the quarter in which the degree is to be conferred. Friday of the tenth week of classes is the deadline for submitting theses and dissertations during each quarter. Those students who complete 74 
Updated 1/17/19 
requirements and submit dissertations after the end of the tenth week of classes and prior to the start of the subsequent quarter will earn a degree for the following quarter, but will not be required to pay fees or enroll in units for that quarter. In such cases, to avoid payment of fees, the manuscript, all forms and degree paperwork must be submitted prior to the first day of the quarter in which the degree is to be earned. 
c. Public Access 
In accordance with UC and UCI policy, all approved thesis/dissertation manuscripts automatically become available for public access and circulation as part of the UCI Libraries collections. The exception is if a student has requested an embargo of public access to their dissertation for a period of up to six years. 
K. Change of Degree Title/Program/Level/or Academic Unit 
1. Change of Degree Level within an Academic Unit (Master's to Ph.D.) 
A student who was admitted to the master's degree program may be considered by the unit's graduate affairs committee for subsequent admission to Ph.D. status. If the committee decides not to accept the student for study leading to the Ph.D., the Dean, Director, or Chair of the academic unit offering the degree must notify the student in writing. If the committee accepts the student for doctoral studies, the recommendation must be transmitted in writing to the Graduate Dean, who has the authority to approve and formally recognize the change to doctoral status. Notification must be sent via the Change of Degree Level form along with two letters, one from the advisor and another professor providing funding support. Only at that time will the student be eligible to register as a doctoral student. International Students: Because of visa sponsorship requirements, an international student ordinarily must provide verification of financial resources prior to formal recognition of doctoral student status. 
2. Change of Degree Level within an Academic Unit (Ph.D. to Master's) 
A student admitted for the Ph.D. degree, who, in the judgment of the unit's graduate affairs committee should not continue past the master's degree, must be notified in writing by the Dean, Director or Department Chair of the academic unit offering the degree. A copy of the letter must be sent to the Graduate Dean. In some cases a doctoral student may choose to leave the program with a master's degree only. It is the responsibility of the academic unit to notify the Graduate Division via the Change of Degree Level form so that the student's record may be updated to reflect the student's degree status. 
3. Change of Degree Program (Major) Within an Academic Unit 
Within the same academic unit, the unit's committee that oversees graduate affairs for a change of degree program may consider a student's request be admitted to a different program. If the committee approves such a change, the Change of Major petition should be transmitted to the Graduate Dean. Upon recommendation of the committee, the Graduate Dean will ordinarily approve and formally recognize the change. 
4. Change of Degree Title and Academic Unit 
75 
Updated 1/17/19 
A current student who wishes to transfer to a graduate program offered by a different academic unit should first consult with the Faculty Graduate Advisor of the desired program or unit. The student must also submit an application for admission to the program. The student must indicate on the application their most recent quarter of enrollment at UCI. 
The receiving unit may require the student to submit additional information, such as current letters of recommendation and a current transcript, as necessary and appropriate. If the student is not admitted by the academic unit that the student seeks to enter, formal notice should be sent to the student with a copy to the Graduate Dean and the student's current academic unit. 
If the unit's graduate affairs committee recommends acceptance of the student, a copy of the formal admission letter must be sent to the Graduate Dean and the student's current academic unit. However, if the student seeks an advanced degree from the initial program, all requirements for that degree must be completed before the change of program or unit becomes effective. 
Students transferring from one program to another must also complete a Withdrawal form available through both the Graduate Division and the Registrar's Office. For "reason for withdrawal," the student should write "transfer from _____ to ____." The student must sign and date the form and submit it to the Graduate Division to complete the transfer process. 
L. Degree Conferral 
1. Registration Requirements 
Master's and doctoral degrees are conferred at the end of the academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. Ordinarily, a graduate student will be registered for the quarter in which all degree requirements are completed and the degree is to be conferred. If all degree requirements (including acceptance of the dissertation or thesis by the librarian and completion of all required examinations) are completed before the first day of the regular academic quarter in which the degree is to be conferred, and the student was registered for the previous regular quarter, registration fees and enrollment are not required. Students who do not meet this second submission deadline may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee in lieu of registration under certain circumstances. (See Section V.C.5. on Filing Fee) Unless payment of a Filing Fee or an academic leave of absence is approved, a graduate student must register each quarter until all degree requirements are completed. 
If a student does not complete the necessary courses by the end of the quarter in which degree conferral is expected, or does not attain the required level of scholarship, registration for the next regular academic session is mandatory; otherwise, student status and candidacy for the degree will lapse. Once status lapses, the degree can be conferred only after readmission of the student, followed by at least one quarter of registration and reinstatement to candidacy. 
2. Certification of Degree Award 
The Graduate Division notifies students by mail of formal degree conferral at the end of the quarter in which the degree is conferred if requested by the student. As soon as all degree requirements are completed, the student may submit a Degree Certification Request form. The Letter of Degree Certification bears the Graduate Dean's signature stamp and University Seal and is the equivalent of the diploma or the official academic transcript posting for employment 
76 
Updated 1/17/19 
and career advancement purposes. The student may request one copy for personal use, or for direct transmission to another educational institution or employer. While there is no charge for this service, only one official Letter of Degree Certification is provided for each degree. 
VIII. GRADUATE STUDENT SERVICES 
A. Program Overview 
While recognizing that quality faculty and excellent curricula are key factors that shape institutional progress and reputation, we must also promote a positive campus climate that enhances the graduate educational experience at UC Irvine. In addition to monitoring the quality and academic progress of graduate students, the Graduate Division plays a critical role in providing support services necessary to ensure that academic success is possible. This includes counseling students about a range of personal, financial, and academic matters, providing up-to-date information about graduate studies at UCI, and disseminating clear information on degree requirements and graduate school policies and procedures. 
B. Graduate Resource Center (GRC) 
The Graduate Resource Center provides coordinated services, events, programs, information and support to the UC Irvine graduate and postdoctoral scholar community. The GRC also serves as a meeting place in which to study, relax and network with fellow students. The GRC facilitates student development and enrichment activities such as the Campuswide New Graduate Student Orientation and is host to a number of workshops on funding, work-life balance, academic and professional development, and writing throughout the year. 
IX. GRADUATE DIVERSITY PROGRAMS 
UC Irvine Graduate Council Diversity Statement 
Diversity is critical to the success of graduate education and is a key priority for our campus. Diversity enhances excellence by opening programs to talented and accomplished individuals who represent and reflect a rich tapestry of perspectives and identities. Having diverse graduate populations also ensures that a broad range of approaches, questions and solutions are incorporated into scientific inquiry, scholarly study, and artistic creativity. Our commitment to an equitable education environment for all is crucial to our continuing capacity to be a national model for inclusive excellence. Graduate Council, therefore, strongly encourages all programs on campus to develop and implement initiatives, such as supportive mentoring, to enhance diversity and to create an inclusive and equitable climate for graduate study. 
A. General Program Overview 
Diversity is an essential component of excellence in all aspects of the mission of UCI: teaching, research and service. The University of California's longstanding goal is to achieve a student body and faculty that reflect the diversity of the state, inclusive of those traditionally under-represented in various academic disciplines and of all cultural, linguistic, geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. To achieve academic excellence, the university places a high value on a diverse graduate student population because diversity is critical to promoting lively intellectual exchange and the variety of ideas and perspectives that are essential to advanced research. In addition, graduate students form the pool of future academic leaders.

The Graduate Division has developed a comprehensive program designed to serve under-represented students. Participants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents selected from groups whose participation in higher education is and has been historically low. 
The program focuses on five major areas: outreach, recruitment, retention, financial support, and graduation. It encompasses program development and support services. The overall goal is to develop and implement strategies that promote a positive academic environment that supports the completion of master's and doctorate degrees. 
In order for the University of California to continue to sustain its diversity goals, we have initiated strategic planning for effective outreach, recruitment and retention programs. These programs include, but are not limited to: 
• Recruitment o Structured recruitment at local and national events geared towards underrepresented students o Participation as a member of the Southern California Forum for Diversity in Graduate 
Education planning committee o Assistance to academic units that seek additional support in developing or adjusting their 
existing recruitment methods o Supporting major on-campus graduate diversity recruitment events o Coordinating summer research and graduate preparation opportunities for diverse undergraduate and master’s students interested in doctoral education at UC Irvine 
• Retention o The Graduate Division is home to the federally funded FIPSE Comprehensive grant, 
DECADE (Diverse Educational Community and Doctoral Experience) which supports recruitment and retention of traditionally underrepresented minorities and women underrepresented in their disciplines. 
▪ Competitive Edge Summer Research Program for entering Ph.D. students who qualify as a DECADE participant. This program provides faculty mentorship in an 8 week summer pre-entry format designed to introduce students to their new campus. o Programming through the Graduate Resource Center that is open to all students and targets 
professional, academic, career and personal development. o Various peer mentorship and student groups are provided as a forum for students to engage 
other students, take on a leadership role and become engaged in their campus 
Central to the success of these programs is the willingness of academic programs and their faculty to systematically evaluate and improve their recruitment and retention strategies. The resources provided by the Graduate Division are intended to facilitate departmental flexibility in developing student support offers that are both competitive and successful in attracting the best diversity students, and in retaining these students and facilitating their success. To address these needs, the Graduate Division has established a pool of supplementary funds that will be available to schools/departments for their involvement in a comprehensive UCI outreach plan in support of their diversity recruitment and retention efforts, including the opportunity to partner in the development of multi-year fellowship support packages. 
B. Diversity Fellowship Eligibility 
Nominees for any diversity fellowship must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Awardees must be admitted to graduate study in a full-time program leading to a Ph.D., except for the Graduate Opportunity Fellowship where M.F.A. students are also eligible. Students beyond UCI’s expected time-to-degree for their discipline are ineligible to receive diversity fellowships. Eligibility

Updated 1/17/19 
requirements vary. Therefore, it is essential that the guidelines for each fellowship be reviewed. Fellowships are awarded only to first-year students entering a graduate program during the fall quarter admission cycle. Continuing student nominations are considered in a separate competition during spring quarter (March-May). Faculty advisors are encouraged to review eligibility criteria for each specific award category. 
C. Fellowship Nomination Procedures 
The Graduate Division centrally administers diversity fellowships. Nominees will be evaluated on academic merit and the strength of their diversity qualifications. All potential nominees shall first be considered by academic units for traditional forms of assistance. Diversity fellowships are only awarded based on a nomination by the diversity fellow's home school or department. 
To assist academic units in the diversity fellowship process, the Graduate Division conducts 2 information sessions each year – both in January. The sessions cover the diversity criteria, changes to the nomination processes, and funding levels for the coming cycle. Dates for the information sessions are published each fall.

Rules for master level studies at RU
The following rules apply to all master level studies at RU [2]. See also RU study and examinations rules and the national qualification framework for higher education.
Each school shall set further rules on master level studies for their programs. They can include more stringent provisions and other aspects of the studies that are not covered by the university-wide rules for master level studies, such as criterias for knowledge, skills and competences in the different master level programs.

Deans may, in exceptional cases, grant exemptions from the university-wide rules for master level studies.

As far as the university-wide rules on master level studies cannot apply, special rules apply to joint and double master level degrees.

Admission requirements
Students must have completed a bachelor degree or other equivalent education at the bachelor level, in a discipline that is considered adequate preparation. Good academic performance  in previous studies is required. Schools shall set further rules on admission requirements, such as on minimum grade for admission.

Organisation
Master level studies at RU are organised in accordance with the framework for higher education issued by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture as 3-4 semesters or 90-120 ECTS-credits.

Study period
The study period shall not exceed 6 semesters for 90 ECTS-credits programs and 8 semesters for 120 ECTS-credits programs. Emphasis is placed on full time studies, but the schools can allow part-time studies in accordance with special rules that they lay down, e.g. on maximum study period. If the study period exceeds the limits above, the student must apply for re-enrollment. Re-enrollment means that the student must apply for admission again. The schools can set rules on admission criteria and minimum grades for courses evaluated at re-enrollment.

Students must earn at least 50% of the credits required for their studies at RU.

Study leave
Study leave may be granted for special personal reasons, such as illness, childbirth or accidents. Maximum study leave is typically 1 year.  a study leave is not counted into the maximum duration of the study period according to these rules.

Evaluation of previous studies
Previous studies that the student has completed more than 9 years before enrollment into a master level program at RU cannot be evaluated as transferred credits in the master level program.

It is only permitted to evaluate courses and transfer credits from courses taken at the same education level and which have been completed with a grade that meets the requirements of the School for minimum grade (see Admission requirements above), which shall not be lower than 6.0 (on a scale of 0-10).

It is permitted to evaluate and transfer credits from previous studies up to 50% of the required credits for the master level degree at RU, given that the previous studies have been continuous and are comparable to the master level program at RU.

From a completed degree, up to 30 ECTS-credits can be evaluated and transferred to the master level studies at RU.

The Schools evaluate applications for transfer of credits from previous studies.

Minimum grades
Minimum grade in courses at the master level is 6.0. Master level students that are permitted to take courses at the bachelor level need to get a minimum of 6.0.

To complete a course, students need to get at least 6.0 in the final examination. If the final examination accounts for less than 20% of the final grade, or the course does not have a final exam, it shall be ensured that a grade of 6.0 is required in the appropriate parts of the course assessment, which test the students‘ individual contribution.

Master thesis/final project
A student who completes MA, ML eða MSc degree from RU shall have finished a research based thesis or final project of at least 30 ECTS-credits.

Exams
On exams and the right to undergo exams see RU general rules on study and examinations.
Entry Requirements for Masters Degrees
Considering postgraduate study, but unsure whether you meet the entry requirements for a Masters-level degree? Postgraduate admissions guidelines vary by course and university, but can be quite flexible.

Your existing qualifications will be important, but you don't necessarily need a great Bachelors degree to apply for a Masters. Your personal circumstances and experience may also be considered during the admissions process.

This guide explains the typical entry requirements for a Masters, which include:

An undergraduate degree in a relevant subject – Depending on the programme and institution, you may need a 2.1 in your Bachelors, but this isn’t always the case
Language proficiency – If English isn’t your first language, you’ll need to display a certain ability level, usually through a language test
Professional experience – Some postgraduate programmes may require you to have some professional experience (this is usually the case for PGCEs and Masters in Social Work)
Entrance exams – These are only required in certain subject areas and qualifications, including some MBAs
Remember that you can check the specific entry requirements for individual Masters degrees using FindAMasters.

Academic qualifications
As postgraduate qualifications, Masters courses are intended for students who've already completed a Bachelors degree or other undergraduate course.

These existing qualifications show prospective universities that you have the knowledge and academic ability to succeed at Masters level. As such, your previous degree results may be one of the most important entry requirements for postgraduate courses.

A Bachelors (or other undergraduate) degree
Most UK universities require applicants to have a Bachelors degree in a relevant subject. International applicants should hold an overseas qualification of a similar standard, from a recognised higher education institution.

In the UK, undergraduate grades are usually labelled as follows:


Undergraduate Degree Classifications
First Class (1st)	The top degree classification. Usually requires an overall mark of 70%+.
Upper Second Class (2.1)	Usually requires an overall mark of 60%+.
Lower Second Class (2.2)	Usually requires an overall mark of 50%+.
Third Class (3rd)	Usually requires an overall mark of 40%+.
Fail	May result from an overall mark below 40%.

You'll normally need an upper second class degree (a '2.1') or its equivalent for entry to a Masters degree. Some universities and courses also accept students with lower second class degrees (2.2s).

In extenuating circumstances, it might even be possible for a student with a third class degree to continue to postgraduate study. For more information, read our advice on applying for a Masters with a lower class degree.

Note that some Masters courses do not specify the exact grade required, and instead request applicants with a 'good honours degree'. This leaves slightly more room for interpretation, but generally means either a first or a 2.1.


International grades
Masters entry requirements may differ outside the UK. You can find out more about requirements for different countries in our study abroad section

Pre-Masters courses
Some universities offer Pre-Masters courses, which provide students with the chance to improve their skills in order to meet the academic requirements for postgraduate study.

Pre-Masters courses may be offered to international students, to help improve their research skills and academic proficiency in the English language.

They may also be offered to UK students who require an academic boost before beginning postgraduate study. An example of this kind of Pre-Masters course is the Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course. The SKE is offered to students who wish to train as teachers, but do not feel confident with the subject they wish to teach.

The Postgraduate Certificate or Diploma
In some cases, a university may ask a student to complete a Postgraduate Certificate (PGCert) or Postgraduate Diploma (PGDip) before registering on the corresponding Masters. This might be the case if a student doesn't have the necessary academic qualifications to enrol on a Masters course straightaway.

The Diploma is itself a postgraduate qualification, and is usually shorter than a full Masters course. Boosting the Diploma to a full Masters is often just a case of carrying out a postgraduate dissertation, but this varies course by course.

Relevant experience
If you do not have the undergraduate degree required by a Masters course, this isn't necessarily the end of the world.

Nor should you panic if you are a mature student, or returning to postgraduate study after a hiatus.

Some universities are willing to consider applicants who do not have the standard requirement of a good undergraduate degree, as long as they have other relevant qualifications or experience.

This is particularly true of vocational courses such as Creative Writing or Journalism, which require the applicant to demonstrate a set of practical skills.

If a candidate has, for example, already spent a period of time working in the industry, or has had work published, this may prove that they have both pre-existing experience, and a real passion for their course.

Ideally, candidates should show both academic qualifications and practical experience in their chosen field.

Language proficiency
If you're studying a Masters abroad, or studying a course that isn't delivered in your first language, you may need to demonstrate language proficiency as part of your admissions process.

This is usually done through a postgraduate language test. These assess your ability to speak, read and write in a specific language at a level sufficient for postgraduate study.

Note that simply having some proficiency in a language may not be enough. In order to gain admission to a foreign-language Masters you'll need to be able to comprehend and communicate complex concepts in this language.

Some existing language proficiencies may be accepted as evidence - such as professional experience or previous periods of study.

Language requirements (and tests) differ slightly in different countries.

English language requirements
If you're studying a Masters in English as a second language, you may be expected to take an English test as part of the admissions process for a Masters programme. (This is likely in countries like the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and parts of Canada).

Tests prove that you have an appropriate level of written and spoken English, and ensure you would not struggle to understand a Masters course taught in English.

There are several different types of English exam. The most common of these are:

IELTS (International English Language Testing System)
TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)
Cambridge Assessment English's C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency
PTE Academic (Pearson Test of English)
Our guides offer more detailed information about different types of English language test.

Other language requirements
Different tests are used in countries outside the UK.

You can find out more about different tests used by specific countries in our study abroad section.

Other requirements
Wondering what else might be required to study a Masters? Here's a summary of some of the other key things that may be required by your course.

Remember you can check the entry requirements for individual courses using our course finder.

Entrance exams
A small number of courses require applicants to take subject-related tests as part of the admissions process.

Examples of these are the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) which is required by some MBAs and other management programmes, and Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) which are sometimes required if an applicant hasn't studied in the UK before.

Financial requirements
You may be required to show evidence that you are aware of the cost of your Masters, and of how you plan to fund the course. For example, your funding might come from personal savings, a postgraduate loan, a scholarship, a charity, or even crowdfunding.

This information might be covered in your application, or in the contract you sign when you register for your course.

Attending an interview
Some courses require applicants to attend an interview as part of the postgraduate admissions process. This is an excellent opportunity for applicants to prove that they're passionate about their subject, and that they have what it takes to flourish on a rigorous postgraduate course.

Before attending a Masters interview, you can read about what to expect and how to prepare for this stage of your application.

References
Most universities don't have time to interview every Masters candidate. This means that they rely on academic references to back up applications, and to prove that candidates have what it takes to succeed at postgraduate level.

Admissions tutors are likely to rely on references just as much as other aspects of a Masters application, such as a personal statement.

Strong references from previous tutors will boost your postgraduate application, so it's important to choose your referees well. Include only those who will be able to make a personal, positive statement about your abilities.

Enthusiasm
Passion is absolutely invaluable when it comes to applying for postgraduate study.

Use your application and interview to show why you are keen to do a Masters, and what it is that gets you excited about your subject.

Showing plenty of enthusiasm for your course may just help to bridge any gaps in your qualifications, and help you to secure a place on a Masters course.
