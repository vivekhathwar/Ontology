However, the  sphere of higher education has still has not seen any concerted efforts for improvement in  access or quality. In the coming decades, India is set to reap the benefits of demographic  dividend with its huge working age population. International Labour Organization (ILO) has  predicted that by 2020, India will have 116 million workers in the age bracket of 20 to 24 years,  as compared to China's 94 million. India has a very favorable dependency ratio and it is  estimated that the average age in India by the year 2020 will be 29 years as against 40 years in  USA, 46 years in Japan and 47 years in Europe. In fact, we have more than 60% of our  population in the age group of 15 to 59 years. This trend is very significant on the grounds that  what matters is not the size of the population, but its age structure. It would be a lost  opportunity if this dividend in not converted into an advantage. Herein lies the significance of  higher education. An educated and productive workforce is what we must strive to achieve  through a concerted effort to improve quality and relevance of higher education.  The XIIth Plan continues to maintain focus on higher education in the country, to make  it more relevant to the global needs and to remove the inequities in access to education  amongst various social groups. Such objectives are sought to be realized by providing adequate  inputs and implementing much needed governance and regulatory reforms in the sector.  Greater emphasis will be laid on the improvement of the quality of teaching-learning processes  in order to produce employable and competitive graduates, post-graduates and PhDs. With  respect to the planning and funding approach, some key changes are envisaged; (a) funding will  be more impact and result oriented, (b) various equity related schemes will be integrated for a  higher impact,(c) instead of unplanned expansion, there will be a focus on consolidating and  developing the existing system adding capacities and (d) there will be a greater focus on  research and innovation. The most significant paradigm shift proposed by the Planning  Commission is in the arena of funding of state higher education system. Strategic funding of this  sector has been strongly proposed in order to make a marked difference in the overall resource  endowment for the state higher education sector. 1  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  The higher education system in India today suffers from many shortcomings. The Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) is only 18.8%1, this means that only a fraction of the population in the  age group of 18-23 years is enrolled in higher education institutions. In addition to very low  access to higher education in general, there are wide disparities between various social groups.  The GERs for SCs, STs and OBCs are far below the average GER. There is also a wide gender  disparity, GER for males is 20.9% while that for females is only 16.5%. There are also differences  in quality of institutions and enrollments between rural and urban areas and between  developed states and not so developed ones. Given these myriad challenges, a drastic change is  required in the approach that has traditionally been adopted for the development of higher  education in the country.  There are three broad categories of the higher education institutions in India, centrally  funded institutions, state funded institutions and private institutions. While the centrally funded  institutions (Central Universities, IITs, NITs, IISERs, Institutes of National Importance etc) receive  generous funding from the center, they have a limited coverage in terms of enrollment. About 94%2 of the students enrolled in state funded or state controlled private institutions come  under the state higher education system. It is worth noting that most private education  institutions are affiliated to state universities. Thus, any efforts for development in this sector  must recognize the importance of state higher education institutions and strive to improve their  status.  While state universities cater to a large number of students, their funding is only a  fraction of that provided to central institutions. Over the years most states have not been able  to allocate enough funds to higher education; shared amongst a large number of institutions  these meagre funds are thinly spread. Plan expenditure on higher education in states is almost  stagnant. As a result, the quality of infrastructure and teaching in state universities is far below  the acceptable levels. Shortage of funds and various regulations cause vacancies in faculty  positions and also compel the state public institutions to look for alternate funding options.  Linked to faculty quality and availability are the issues of quality of teaching, research output  and general management; in state universities these areas have been grossly compromised.  1 All India Survey on Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, 2010 11 (Provisional) 2 XIIth Five year Plan, Planning Commission of India, New Delhi, 2012  2  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  In order to raise funds, most universities rely heavily on the affiliation fees they receive  from affiliated institutions and on self-financing courses. Treating affiliation fees as source of  income and starting courses for revenue-generation have led to further dilution of quality and  perpetuation of inequity. Except a few institutions, most affiliated institutions depend heavily  upon the University for administrative, examination related and curricular matters. This adds to  the burden of the university as it is reduced to an administrative and exam conducting unit  rather than an institution focused on promoting teaching, research and faculty development of  associated colleges. This system also takes away the autonomy of affiliated institutions in  teaching and conducting examinations. Instead of increasing access in a positive way, the  affiliation system creates a highly centralized and inefficient institutional structure, which does  not allow its constituents any room for creativity in teaching, learning, curriculum development  or research. In such a structure, quality enhancement can only be brought about by reducing the  burden at the university level and giving greater autonomy and accountability to the  constituents through affiliation reforms.  In addition to general issues about the quality of infrastructure, teaching and learning in  state universities as compared to central universities, there is also an element of intra state  difference within the state which leads to better institutions developing in urban or industrial  areas with consequent neglect of rural and tribal areas. There is a lack of vision and planning for  the development of institutions and the higher education sector at the state level. Given the  complexities of managing the access and equity issues within and amongst states as well as the  large number of institutions that already come under the state university system, there is a  crying need for planning in higher education focusing on the state as the basic unit. This  planning should be done by an autonomous body that can raise and allocate funds from the  state as well as central governments for higher education and also explore options of revenue  generation through research, consulting, and private and industry partnerships.  The State Universities are already provided some funds from the central government  through the University Grants Commission. However, UGC’s mandate allows it to fund only a  limited number of institutions that are Section 12B and 2f (UGC Act) compliant. This excludes about 33% of the State Universities and 51% of the colleges under such universities 3. UGC is  also not allowed to channelize funds through the state government or through any entity other  than an educational institution, which makes it impossible for the UGC to fund any planning, and  3 University Grants Commission Annual Report, 2010-11  3  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  expansion activity through a state level higher education body. UGC as a regulator should be  actively involved in planning for new institutions but the present system does not permit it to do  so. Thus states often complain of being unaware of the development funds that come to the  state institutions from the centre; this makes planning and funding very difficult for the states.  An optimum solution will be to create an alternate way (a centrally sponsored scheme) of  providing funding to a larger number of institutions and channelize fund through a body that  ensures cohesive and integrated planning at the state level. Such a solution eminent  management sense since it is almost impossible for any central agency to deal with 35000 odd  institutions on a one on one basis.  Given the pitiable condition, wide reach of the state university system and limitations of  the UGC, there is a strong need for a strategic intervention for the improvement of access,  equity and quality in Indian higher education, that focuses on state universities and state  institutions though a special centrally; sponsored scheme in a mission mode. This document  proposes a new centrally sponsored scheme for higher education which will spread over two  plan periods (XIIth and XIIIth) and will focus on state higher educational institutions. The scheme  will be called Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA).  There are 316 states public universities and 13,024 colleges, that can be covered under  RUSA. The funding will be provided in the (Center : State) ratio of 90:10 for North-Eastern States  & J&K, 75:25 for Other Special Category States (Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and  65:35 for Other States and UTs. Funding will be available to private government-aided  institutions also, subject to their meeting certain pre-conditions, for permitted activities based  on laid down norms and parameters.  RUSA will have a completely new approach towards funding higher education in state  universities; it is based on key principles of performance-based funding, incentivizing well  performing institutions and decision making through clearly defined norms, which will establish  and rely upon a management information system to gather the essential information from  institutions. RUSA will aim to provide greater autonomy to universities as well as colleges and  have a sharper focus on equity-based development, and improvement in teaching-learning  quality and research. It will be a new flagship scheme of the government that will pave the way  for far reaching reforms at the state level.  Many of the problems in the state universities are linked to the archaic systems and  regulations that govern them. Without bringing about reforms in the existing governance and  4  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  regulatory systems, it will not be possible to unleash the potential of the state universities. The  reforms initiated under RUSA will build a self-sustaining momentum that will push for greater  accountability and autonomy of state institutions and impress upon them the need to improve  the quality of education. In order to be eligible for funding under RUSA, states will have to fulfill  certain prerequisites. These include the creation of a State Higher Education Council, creation of  accreditation agencies, preparation of the state perspective plans, commitment of certain  stipulated share of funds towards RUSA, academic, sectoral and institutional governance  reforms, filling faculty positions etc. Under the scheme, an initial amount will be provided to the  State government to prepare them for complying with these a-priori requirements.  Once eligible for funding under RUSA, after meeting the prerequisite commitments, the  States will receive funds on the basis of achievements and outcomes. The yardstick for deciding  the quantum of funds for the states and institution comprise the norms that reflect the  performance in key result areas (access, equity and excellence). The State plans will capture the  current position of the states and institutions with respect to these indicators, as well as the  targets that need to be achieved. The State Higher Education Council will undertake this process  of planning, execution and evaluation, in addition to other monitoring and capacity building  functions. The detailed institutional structure of RUSA is also presented in this document. At the  national level, the scheme will be implemented by the RUSA Mission Authority and assisted by  the Project Advisory Group, Technical Support Group and Project Directorate. The main agency  through which RUSA will work in the States will be the State Higher Education Council (SHEC), an  autonomous body that will function at an arm’s length from the state and central governments.  It maybe be immediately created through an executive order by the issued by the States, but  within must be accorded statutory status within 5 years. RUSA has suggested a composition and  structure for the Council. The Council will be expected to perform planning, monitoring &  evaluation, quality assurance and academic functions, as well as advisory and funding functions.  It will plan for the development of higher education at the state level and the State Higher  Education Plan prepared by it would constitute the main instrument to guide the entire  transformative process in the state higher education sector. SHEC will be assisted by State  Project Directorate and Technical Support Group. In every institution, the Governing Body and a  Project Monitoring Unit will oversee the project progress.  5  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  The key objectives of RUSA are to improve access, equity and quality in higher education  through planned development of higher education at the state level. Such planning will create  by creating new academic institutions, and expand the existing institutions, that are self-reliant  in terms of quality education, professionally managed, and characterized by greater inclination  towards research and provide students with education that is relevant to them as well the  nation as a whole.  6  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  1 Background  Over the years, higher education in India has gone through a phase of unprecedented  expansion, marked by a huge increase in the volume of students, an exponential increase in the  number of institutions and a quantum jump in the level of public funding. The increase however  has not been commensurate with the growth of the population and its diverse needs.  Today, the higher education system as a whole is faced with many challenges such as  financing and management, access, equity, relevance and reorientation of policies and programs  for laying emphasis on values, ethics and quality of higher education together with the  assessment of institutions and their accreditation. These issues are of vital importance for the  country, since higher education is the most powerful tool to build a knowledge based society  for the future. The enormity of the challenges of providing equal opportunities for quality higher  education to an ever-growing number of students is also a historic opportunity for correcting  sectoral and social imbalances, reinvigorating institutions, crossing international benchmarks of  excellence and extending the frontiers of knowledge.  Recognizing this requirement, as well as the basic fact that the institutions of higher  learning have to perform multiple roles like creating new knowledge, acquiring new capabilities,  producing an intelligent human resource pool, the Indian higher education system has to brace  itself to address global challenges by channelizing teaching, research and extension activities,  and maintaining the right balance between the need and the demand.  Higher education needs to be viewed as a long-term social investment for the  promotion of economic growth, cultural development, social cohesion, equity and justice. In order to meet the XIIth Plan aim of inclusive growth and to ensure genuine endogenous and  sustainable development along with social justice and equity, the higher education sector has to  play a pivotal role, especially in generating research-based knowledge and developing a critical  mass of skilled and educated personnel. Within this philosophical paradigm, some of the issues  pertaining to the higher education system have been identified, that need to be squarely  addressed for the balanced development of higher education in India.  The globalized era has necessitated inculcation of competitive spirit at all levels. This can  be achieved only by bringing quality of highest standards to every sphere of work. Therefore,  the quality of higher education has become a major concern today. Needs and expectations of  society are changing very fast and the quality of higher education needs to be  7  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  sustained at the desired level. The quality of higher education rests on the quality of all its  facets, be it the faculty, staff, students, or infrastructure. As such, all policies, systems and  processes should be clearly directed towards attaining improvements in all the relevant facets  for an overall rise in the quality of education.  The XIIth Plan has kept the above concerns in mind and called for measures that provide  higher education to a larger number of students while ensuring equal opportunities for all  sections of society and maintaining focus on quality. The XIIth Plan deviates from the previous  plans by suggesting some strategic shifts in the approach towards higher education. Given these  strategic shifts and goals talked about in the XIIth Plan, there is a need to develop a policy that  presents this much needed holistic plan for the development of higher education in India.  This document explores the present condition and past development experiences in the  higher education sector and proposes a new central scheme to address the needs of the sector.  The background section looks in detail at the issues of access, equity and excellence in the  Indian higher education system. In the section on State Universities, the importance of these  issues in the higher education system and the problems faced with respect to these issues are  explored in detail. This is followed by a section illustrating the urgent need for a strategic  intervention in the State Universities. The document then delves into the new scheme, Rashtriya  Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan, its key principles, salient features, and institutional and financial  structures.  The policy for the development of higher education has been mainly governed by the  “National Policy on Education” of 1968 (as modified in 1986 and 1992) and its Programme of  Action adopted in 1992. The 1986 policy and its Programme of Action of 1992 were based on  two land mark reports namely, the “University Education Commission Report” of 1948-49  (popularly known as the Radhakrishnan Commission Report), and the “Education Commission  Report” of 1964-66, (popularly known as the Kothari Commission Report). These two reports, in  fact, laid down the basic framework for the National Policy of 1986 for higher education in the  country. The Radhakrishnan Commission on University Education (1948) had enumerated  essential goals for development of higher education in India. The commission eloquently  articulated the reforms needed in the education sphere in following words:  “The most important and urgent reform needed in education is to  transform it, to endeavor to relate it to the life, needs and aspirations of the  8  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  people and thereby make it the powerful instrument of social, economic and  cultural transformation necessary for the realization of the national goals. For  this purpose, education should be developed so as to increase productivity,  achieve social and national integration, accelerate the process of  modernization and cultivate social, moral and spiritual values.”  The National Policy on Higher Education (1986) translated the vision of the  Radhakrishnan Commission and the Kothari Commission into an actionable policy by setting five  main goals for higher education, as enumerated below:  • Access: Greater Access requires an enhancement of the education institutional capacity  of the higher education sector to provide opportunities to all who deserve and desire  higher education.  • Equity: Equity involves fair access of the poor and the socially disadvantaged groups to  higher education  • Quality and Excellence: involve provision of education in accordance with accepted  standards so that students receive available knowledge of the highest standards that  helps them to enhance their human resource capabilities.  • Relevance: involves promotion of education so as to develop human resources keeping  pace with the changing economic, social and cultural development of the country; and  • Value Based Education: involves inculcating basic moral values among the youth.  The Action Plan of 1992 included schemes and programs that were directed towards the  expansion of intake capacity in general, and with respect to the disadvantaged groups such as  the poor, SCs, STs, minorities, girls, physically challenged persons, and those in the educationally  backward regions, in particular. The Schemes/Programs were designed to improve quality by  strengthening academic and physical infrastructure, in order to promote excellence in those  institutions which have exhibited potential for excellence, and to develop curriculum to  inculcate right values among the youth.  An analysis of the past Five Year Plans indicates that, there have been continuous efforts to  strengthen the base by developing infrastructure, improving the quality through several programs  and schemes, introducing reforms in content and evaluation and encouraging creation of new knowledge through research. The focus of Vth Five-Year Plan was on infrastructure development; the  VIth Plan onwards the focus shifted to consolidation and quality improvement. The VIIth Plan laid  emphasis on research and academic developments. It was from this plan  9  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  onward that the development of centers of excellence and area study programs got special attention. From the VIIIth Plan onward, the need for differential funding was recognized, it was  envisaged that the developing departments would be provided necessary funds to bring up their facilities and activities to an optimum level for their teaching and general research programs. The IXth Plan aimed at gearing the system of higher education to meet the challenges arising out of the major social, economic and technological changes. The focus of the Xth Plan was on  quality and relevance of higher education, research and development, management in financing and the use of the new information and communication technologies. The Xth Plan provided the basis for higher education in the 21st century4.  The XIth Plan laid renewed emphasis on higher education and the three targets of  broadening access, making higher education inclusive and promoting improvements in quality. In the XIth Plan, share of education in total plan outlay increased from mere 6.7% in the Xth Plan  to 19.4%, of which 30% was earmarked for higher education. This was a nine-fold increase over the Xth Plan, viz. Rs. 84,943 crores against Rs. 9,500 crores5.  1.1 XIIth Plan  1.1.1 Objectives  The XIth as well as the XIIth Plan have continued to lay emphasis on improving access,  equity and excellence. XIIth Plan mentions that expansion must continue with consolidation  being an important element; special importance is also given to excellence or quality. Given its  subjective nature and being a conspicuous weakness in the Indian system, it is a hard aim to  achieve. Quality must be pursued by each and every single higher education institution and not  just by a few selected ones. The Plan also talks about incorporating lessons learnt from the past  for designing better policies to improve access and equity.  The plan lays out the following as the objectives that must guide central, state and private institutions in the country6   1) Higher education in India to be brought in line with and at the frontiers of global  trends in higher education and knowledge development;  4 Working Group for the 11th Plan on Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development 5 Report of the Steering Committee, Secondary Higher and Technical Education for XIth Plan, Planning Commission, April 2009 6 XIIth Five year Plan, Planning Commission of India, New Delhi, 2012  10  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited 2) Improvement in overall quality of teaching‐learning in an average higher education  institution in the country;  3) Arresting and reversing the trend of group inequalities in access to quality higher  education;  4) Creation of an additional capacity for 2 million more students from eligible age  cohort to have access to higher education in a demand‐driven manner; and  5) Undertaking governance and regulatory reforms that focus on institutional  autonomy within a framework of accountability and build adaptive capacity of the  system.  1.1.2 Approach  The XIIth Plan cautions against single-minded and narrow strategies for improving  access and equity, as they tend to do so at the expense of quality. A holistic approach is argued  for, so that expansion is not just about accommodating ever larger number of students in higher  education, but also about enabling the expanded pool of students to make choices of subjects,  levels and institutions so that they can realize their full potential and realize their personal goals.  Redressing multiple and graded inequalities in higher education is not just about  increasing the GER among disadvantaged groups, it is also about enhancing their presence in the  centres of excellence, taking care of their post-admission needs and redesigning curricula to  take into account their specific requirements. The challenge of excellence is not just about  placing a few institutions and individuals at par with global norms for excellence, it is also about  expanding the pool of institutions, scholars and students who continuously strive to improve  quality to achieve global excellence. Thus, an interconnected strategy for higher education  development is needed to address issues of access, equity and excellence in a coordinated  manner.  1.1.3 Strategic Shift  Access, Equity, and Excellence would continue to be the main thrust areas of the XIIth  Plan in higher education. However, considering the inter-linkages between them and taking into  consideration the current realities of the higher education, these objectives need to be pursued  differently. A strategic shift in thinking is needed in several critical areas ranging from issues of  11  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  access and equity to teaching-learning process, research, governance, funding and monitoring. These shifts are explained below.7  1) Increase funds for higher education significantly and use strategically. This investment  has to come from both public and private sources and both from central and state  exchequer.  2) Connect various funding streams to specific outcomes and desired impact. This would  need reforms in governance arrangements at all national, state and institutional levels  and with suitable implementation frameworks and monitoring arrangements  3) Foster institutional autonomy and link meaningful academic autonomy and managerial  flexibility with effective monitoring and overall accountability through competitiveness.  4) Targeted, integrated and effective equity related schemes, instead of the existing maze  of multiple, diffused and low-value schemes, so as to give effect to the Constitutional  ideal of Equality of Opportunity. Mechanisms for connecting national and state equity  programs are needed.  5) Institutional differentiation and distinctiveness should be encouraged. The spectrum of  higher educational institutions must include multidisciplinary research universities as  well as short-cycle vocational education institutions.  6) A renewed focus must be laid on research by integrating teaching and research.  7) Shift from input-centric and credential-focused approach to learner-centric approach.  8) Consolidate rather than expand the number of institutions to ensure that the capacity  expansion is done at lower capital costs and, quality is maintained while expanding the  system. New institutions can still be set up in areas uncovered so far.  9) A move towards internationalization of higher education is imperative.  10) Creation of alliances, networks, clusters, and consortia of academic institutions amongst  themselves and with the research institutions and industry should be facilitated, to  create a self-governing system.  1.2 Higher education today  Over the years, considerable progress has been made in higher education in the  country. In the XIth Plan, India moved from an “elite” system of higher education to a “mass”  7 XIIth Five year Plan, Planning Commission of India, New Delhi  12  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan  Draft for Circulation  Not to be cited  system when the GER crossed the threshold of 15%. However, our GER at 18.8% still remains  below the world average of 29% (as of 2010).  Figure 1: India's GER over time 10  35.00%  30%  30.00%  25.2%  25.00%  20.00%  15%  15.00%  DJJOTO  12.74%  11.89%  11%  10.00%  5.00%  0.40%.  0.00% +  1950-51  2005  6  2 006-7  2007-8  2008-9  2011-12  2012-13  2017-18  2020-21  This increase in GER has, naturally, been a ccompanied by an increase in the number of  higher education institutions serving the population. From 30 universities and 695 colleges in 1950-51, we have risen to 634 universities and 33,023 colleges today. This is a 20-fold and 46  fold increase in the number of universities and colleges, respectively. However, as the low GER  very aptly indicates, increase in the number of institutions has still remained inadequate to  meet the increased demand for higher education.  8 All India Survey on Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, 2010-11 (Provisional), October 2012  9 UNESCO Institute for Statistics (http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/tertiary education.aspx as accessed on 24th October, 2012)  10 Selected Education Statistics, MHRD  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 2: Growth of universities and colleges in India11  The question of GER and educating the youth has gained additional significance given  the critical stage of development that our nation is going through. According to International  Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates, by 2020 India will have 116 million workers in the age  group of 20-24 years as against 94 million in China. To take advantage of this demographic  dividend (indeed, to prevent socio-economic complications arising out of a large unemployable  young population) India urgently needs to strengthen its higher education systems, in order to  prepare this massive workforce for productive employment.  11 University Grants Commission, Annual Report 2010-11  14  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 3: Average age in 202012  Much needs to be done in terms of bringing higher number of students from senior  secondary to higher education, overcoming geographical and socio-economic disparities while  maintaining focus on quality. The following sections take a critical look at Indian higher  education with respect to three important dimensions: access, equity and excellence.  1.2.1 Access  As mentioned above, India has a very low GER of 18.8%, indicating that only about a  fifth of the population in the age group of 18-23 years has access to higher education in India. As  illustrated in the figure below, India’s GER is far below those of most developed countries and  even below those of the other BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia and China).  Figure 4: GER of select countries13  *GER for India (15%) corresponds to 2007  Access to higher education differs widely across states (Figure 6 & 7). The more  progressive southern states have better GERs as well as higher availability of educational  institutions. This trend is also seen from the NSSO estimates (Figure 8.) As mentioned in later  12 ILO Estimates and Projections of the Economically Active Population: 1990-2020 (Sixth Edition), October 2011 13 The Global Competitiveness Report 2011-2012, World Economic Forum, UNESCO Institute for Statistics (accessed May 4, 2011)  15  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  sections, these are also states with higher per capita spending on higher education. While most  hilly region states have low institutional density, their GERs vary from high to low. This may be  due to the fact that higher education does not completely depend on the physical availability of  institutions but also on other socio-economic factors such as income of the parents, willingness  to migrate etc. High-population density states present a different picture. Here on an average,  institutional availability per 1000 sq kms in unable to ensure good access due to the large  population and possible lack of institutional capacity. In Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Rajasthan,  both the institutional density and GER are very low.  As can be seen in the data provided below (Figure 5), 374 districts were identified as  Educationally Backward Districts in the country for the Model College Scheme under XIth Plan  due to their low GER. There are still 191 districts with College-Population Index below 8, which means that every college must service about 12,500 students. Also, on an average, about 1/3rd  of the weak districts are in tribal/hilly/border/forested areas, pointing to the special  development needs of these areas.  Figure 5: CPI for 374 districts with GER below national average (as of 2001)14  14 Thyagarajan Committee Report on Model Colleges Scheme, 2009  16  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 6: GER by State15 Figure 7: Institutional density by State16  15 Refer to Annexure I: States at a Glance 16 Refer to Annexure I: States at a Glance  17  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 8: GER by State17  TOTAL 19.40% Andaman & Nicobar 14.40%  Pondicherry 46.70% Tamil Nadu 31.80%  Kerala 34.40% Lakshdweep 4.80%  Goa 50.30% Karanataka 21.10% Andhra Pradesh 21.60%  Maharashtra 23.60% Dadra & Nagar Haveli 5.90%  Daman and Diu 21.80% Gujarat 14.70% Madhya Pradesh 15.30%  Chattisgarh 20.50%  Orissa 14.00% Jharkhand 13.70% West Bengal 12.30%  Assam 12.80% Meghalaya 10.20%  Tripura 9.10% Mizoram 11.40% Manipur 26.60% Nagaland 19.80% Arunachal Pradesh 15.70%  Sikkim 14.00%  Bihar 9.00% Uttar Pradesh 18.10%  Rajasthan 18.70%  Delhi 41.20% Haryana 20.30% Uttaranchal 39.90% Chandigarh 46.60%  Punjab 20.00% Himachal Pradesh 24.50% Jammu & Kashmir 23.90%  0.00% 10.00% 20.00% 30.00% 40.00% 50.00% 60.00%  17 Estimated from unit level data contained in CD of NSS 66th Round of Employment and Unemployment by Bino Paul, Labour Market Research Facility, TISS  18  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 9: GER in Public & Private Aided & Private Unaided18  In respect of GER in Public, Private and Private Unaided institutions estimates from NSSO  highlights that 46% is in the Public space, while over 50% is in the Private (aided & unaided) space  (Figure 9) A high GER does not depend only on the attributes of higher education in the country  because at times the institution receives a limited pool of students from the school education  system and socio-economic disparities often force some students to drop out of schools after  primary and secondary levels. The transition rate of students completing higher secondary  education and entering higher education stood at 61.4% in 2007. This now stands at 67.5%, which  can be significantly improved (Figure 10 and 11). The success of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and  Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and the consequent improvement in transition  rates makes a strong case for enhancement of financial support for expansion, upgradation and  quality improvement of higher education system. Such enhancement can bring about balanced  growth of new institutions, based on spatial and need based planning. This, in turn, can help  absorb the ever increasing number of students completing the higher secondary level  18 Ibid  19  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 10: Transition from higher secondary to higher education19  Figure 11: Students transiting from higher secondary to higher education20  1.2.1.1 XIth Plan Experience: Access  In the XIth Plan, total enrollments in degree and diploma programmes grew by 4.8  million, from 15.4 million to 20.2 million. In the XIIth Plan, the target is to create enrollment  capacity of 10 million, with 1 million for distance learning, 3.3 million for skill-granting diplomas  and 5.7 million for degree programs. This would help an additional 3 million students of each age cohort (18-23) to enter the higher education stream and raise the GER to 27%21 by 2017.  The enrollment capacity of central institutions will have to be doubled from 0.6 million to 1.2  million while state institutions will add another 2.6 million. The rest of the capacities are  expected to be created in the private education segment.  19 Selected Education Statistics, MHRD 20 Selected Education Statistics, MHRD 21 12th Five Year Plan, Planning Commission of India, New Delhi, 2012  20  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  In the XI Plan, two Centrally-Sponsored Schemes were proposed, to set up higher  educational institutions and expand existing educational institutions. The first scheme intended  to set up a Model Degree College in each of the identified 374 Educationally Backward Districts  (EBD) identified, where the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) was less than the national average of  12.4 % in relation to the total population in the 18-23 age group (as per the Selected Educational  Statistics of the year 2006-07). Colleges already in existence, but set up after 1st January 2008  (i.e. after the in-principle approval of the scheme by the NDC) were also eligible to be covered.  The second scheme intended to incentivize states to establish degree colleges and new  engineering colleges or expand existing higher educational institutions in those districts where  the GER was between 12.4% and 15%. The physical target was to set up 50 new universities, 500  new colleges and 30 new engineering colleges under this scheme.  The central-state funding pattern for the scheme to set up Model Degree Colleges in  374 EBDs was 1:1 for special category states (i.e. all North-Eastern states, Sikkim, Jammu &  Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and 1:2 for the rest of the states. The cost of each  model degree college was Rs. 8 crores and was later revised to Rs. 4 crores. Land was to be  provided free of cost by the state Governments, who would also bear the recurring costs.  The response of the states to the scheme of setting up model degree colleges in 374 EBDs was not very enthusiastic. Under the scheme, the centre had to contribute 1/3rd of the  cost (Rs 8 crores or Rs. 4 crores under the revised cost) of setting up a model college. As on 31st  March 2012, only 153 proposals had been received from the states of which only 86 had been  approved. There are a couple of reasons for the poor performance of these schemes. Firstly,  many states and institutions considered the conditions for eligibility too strict and requested for  relaxation in them (e.g. to bring colleges set up before 1st January 2008 within the scheme’s  ambit). Secondly, due the lack of funds with state governments, they were not able to match the  grants made by the centre and not many states applied for setting up colleges under the scheme. The central contribution of 1/3rd of capital cost was considered very low by many  states. Even the decrease in the cost limit to Rs 4 crores did not provide the necessary impetus  and the scheme did not fully achieve its objectives and targets.  The second scheme, i.e. the incentivization of states for setting up new institutions and  expanding existing institutions, was proposed in the year 2010, but could not be sanctioned  since the Planning Commission recommended that an umbrella scheme subsuming similar  21  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  schemes may be taken up in the XIIth Plan. This recommendation of the Planning Commission  constitutes the basis for the formulation of the scheme presently under consideration.  1.2.2 Equity  Inclusive development is another important goal of the XIIth Plan. Since economic  resources, mobility, and socio-cultural background are important criteria in determining the  accessibility and cost of higher education for a student, disparities are widely visible across  geographical regions, genders and socio-economic and socio-religious groups (Figure 10). The GER  amongst SCs and STs is much lower than the national average, Muslims also have a very low GER.  Scheduled castes and minorities have lower access mostly due to socio-economic factors while  tribal areas have lesser number of institutions serving them. Students from these groups are often  required to migrate for education, in which case, non-availability of residential facilities and  supporting infrastructure in the institutions is a major concern. These inferences are drawn from  the estimates of NSSO’s 61st and 64th round.  Figure 12: Gross Enrollment Ratio across categories22  *This data collected by the National Sample Survey Organization uses a different methodology for calculation of GER, the figures above may not be the same at those compiled by MHRD  22 Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, MHRD Statistics of Higher & Technical Education as on 30th September 2009 22  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Gender disparities are an important issue to reckon with (Figure 13). In the age group 18-23  years, females are way behind males. While GER for women and girls is estimated to be 15.8  percent, it is 22.8 for men. This calls for a more sustained effort in addressing gender disparities  Figure 13: GER for Male and Female23  Spanning the issue of inclusion is another conisderation, disparities between various caste  groups. Figures (14, 15 and 16) show the GER among Schedule Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes across States based on the 66th round of NSSO estimates. Inter-state  variations amongest these groups in the development of Higher Education are glaring in India.  Some states have expanded Higher Education Systems fast but some are lagging behind. It is  observed that efforts taken in the XIth Plan for improving equal access among social groups has  paid dividends. However, much more needs to be done to reduce inter state disparities amongst  social groups and improve their GER..  23 Estimated from unit level data contained in CD of NSS 66th Round of Employment and Unemployment by Bino Paul, Labour Market Research Facility, TISS  23  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 14: GER of ST population across states24  Figure 15: GER of SC population across states25  24 NSSO, 66th Round (2009-10) 25 NSSO, 66th Round (2009-10)  24  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 16: GER of OBC population across states26  Total Andaman & Nicobar Pondicherry Tamil Nadu Kerala Lakshdweep Goa Karanataka Andhra Pradesh Maharashtra Dadra & Nagar Haveli Daman and Diu Gujarat Madhya Pradesh Chattisgarh Orissa Jharkhand West Bengal Assam Meghalaya Tripura Mizoram Manipur Nagaland Arunachal Pradesh Sikkim Bihar Uttar Pradesh Rajasthan Delhi Haryana Uttaranchal Chandigarh Punjab Himachal Pradesh Jammu & Kashmir  0.0% 10.0% 20.0% 30.0% 40.0% 50.0% 60.0% 70.0% 80.0% 90.0%  26 NSSO, 66th Round (2009-10)  25  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 17: GER of Other populations across states27  Further, GER amongst Caste Groups (SC, ST ,OBC and others) point out that more efforts  need to be put in improving GER of SC (12.2%) and GER of ST (9.7%) in order to enable them to reach the national average. While, the GER of (SC, ST and OBC) according to the 66th round  NSSO estimates (Figure 18) are a definite improvement over the earlier NSSO estimates (Figure  10), more needs to be done.  Figure 18: GER (18-23) and Inter Caste Disparities28  27 NSSO, 66th Round (2009-10) 28 ibid  26  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  An analysis of the GER amongst caste groups along Rural and Urban areas bring out stark  inequities. It is observed that GER for SC( 9.6%), ST (7.1%), OBC (15%) in rural areas is quite low  compared to their respective GER in urban areas (Figure 19). This major difference calls for  greater attention and there is a need to improve education facilities as well as opportunities for  these social groups to have access to higher education.  Figure 19 : GER among Socio Economic Groups  Religious group disparities are yet another important consideration in any discussion on  inclusion. Figure 20 highlights the inter-religious group disparities. While most religious groups  show a GER above the national average, Muslims for various socio-cultural reasons have lagged  behind in education including higher education. Further, there is rural-urban disparity in GER  across religious groups (Figure 21 ) with Muslims rate lowest (6.7%), Hindus appears to be  comparatively better off (14.7%). While the reasons for low GER of Muslims in rural areas has  been explained above, the lower enrolment of Hindus could be traced to depressed caste  groups within their fold.  27  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 20: GER among Religious Group29  Figure 21: GER among Religious Groups; Rural and Urban30  Figure 22 brings out the GER of Inter Caste Categories along Socio-Religious groups with focused intervention for improving enrolment rate in case of Muslim OBCs (11.20%) and Hindu STs (9%) and Hindu SCs (12%)  29 NSSO, 66th Round (2009-10) 30 NSSO, 66th Round (2009-10)  28  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 22: GER of Inter Caste Categories along Socio-Religious Groups31  The enrolment rates in case of Occupational groups in rural areas (Figure 23) indicates that  aricultural labour (7%) is the lowest while Self employed in Non-ariculture (13.80%) and Self  Employed in Agriculture (15.80%) are comparatively better but all these groups need policy and  programme initiatives to improve their GER. While, the GER amongst Occupation group in Urban  areas(Figure 24) show positive trends, the enrolment rate among causual labour (10.80%)  requires policy intervention.  Figure 23: GER among Occupational Groups, Rural32  31 NSSO, 66th Round (2009-10) 32 Source: NSSO 2009-10  29  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 24: GER among Occupational Groups, Urban33  Finally, GER amongst rural areas (13.9%) is much below the national average, while in Urban  areas is more than twice that of rural area (Figure 25).  Figure 25: GER within Locations34  33 NSSO, 66th Round (2009-10) 34 NSSO, 66th Round (2009-10)  30  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  The above estimates drawn from the 66th round of NSSO amply demonstrates that while  there have been considerable improvements in equal access to higher education amongst  various groups mentioned above largely due to various interventionist strategies adopted in the 11th Plan, there is a need for a more holistic strategy to be adopted. These interventions should  be by improving educational infrastructure in under-served areas, to stimulate their  participation, encourage through policy interventions participation of marginalized population  groups and provide selective opportunities for accelerated participation of such groups.  Figure 26: Distribution of Women’s Universities and Colleges35  The other aspect of equity is women’s access to higher education. Many socio-cultural  factors contribute to lesser women enrolling for higher education and inadequate infrastructural  support at the institutions further reduces their participation. Rajasthan, Odisha, Chhattisgarh,  Jharkhand, Assam and Bihar are amongst the lowest in terms of gender parity in higher  education (Figure 27), with alarmingly low levels amongst the ST and SC populations. Given the  socio-cultural make-up of our society, it has often been felt that opening women’s colleges and  universities is a useful way of increasing access as the parents are more comfortable in sending  female students to such establishments, especially if the students are sent to other states or  cities. The proportion of women’s colleges is (8.6%) is more than women’s universities (1.1%),  however, these proportions are still fairly low.  35 All India Survey on Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, 2010 11 (Provisional),  31  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 27: Gender Parity across States36  The GER as well as distribution of institutions across rural and urban areas is much  skewed. The GER in rural areas is almost half as that of urban areas (Figure 12), especially  amongst women. With the mushrooming of private colleges and universities without any central  or state planning, the balance between urban and rural spread of institutions is increasingly  36 Selected Education Statistics, MHRD  32  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  tilting towards urban areas. While India is tending towards urbanization, 68.8%37 of the  population still resides in rural areas. And even though development of educational hubs has its  advantages, the rural areas should not remain deprived of access to higher education  institutions. Thus increasing institutional reach in rural areas must also be addressed in a  targeted manner.  Figure 28: Location-wise distribution of Institutions 38  1.2.2.1 XIth Plan Experience: Equity  Efforts made towards improving equity in higher education such as setting up of 374  Model colleges, establishment of universities in backward areas, reservation of seats for  disadvantages groups, and provision of student loans and scholarships have indeed led to  marked improvement in certain states. The main lessons learnt from these efforts have been  that firstly, improving enrollments in general will not ameliorate inequities and special efforts  will be required to deal with problems of geographically backward areas, women and backward  classes; furthermore, specific initiatives will have to be taken for each category. Secondly, the  multiplicity of central and state run schemes and scholarships and cumbersome application  processes prevent many students from being aware of and availing many benefits.  37 Census 2011 38 All India Survey on Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, 2010-11 (Provisional)  33  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure29: State-wise distribution of Institutions 39  1.2.3 Excellence  Excellence in higher education is also a major aim of the XIIth Plan. The quality of our  current education system leaves much to be desired. As per the Times Higher Education  Rankings 2012-13, the top ranked Indian institutions are IIT Kharagpur (234), IIT Bombay (258)  and IIT Roorkee (267). The top ranked institutions as per the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) System  2012 were IIT Delhi (212), IIT Bombay (227) and IIT Kanpur (278). Apart from the fact that none  39 University Grants Commission, 2012  34  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  of the Indian institutions ranked are in the top 200, interestingly no university finds a place in  these rankings. These rankings are limited in their scope and coverage of institutions, especially  those in Asia. However it is worth looking at the components on which good quality Universities  are judged. Firstly, single discipline Universities and Universities dedicated to just postgraduate  studies are not considered because of their narrow focus and areas of strength. The major  components consider teaching (learning environment, student teacher ratio, quality of  curriculum), research (volume, income from research, reputation), and citations (research  influence). Other factors included are international outlook, industry income, employer  reputation etc. Indian higher education is not particularly strong in the above-mentioned areas,  which is certainly a cause for concern. The university system in India needs to look at these  parameters closely and endeavour to attain higher levels in these areas, especially at the  research outcomes.  Apart from international rankings, other parameters of judging quality are employability and employer satisfaction. According to a survey done by World Bank-Federation of Indian  Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), 64% of employers are “somewhat”, “not very”, or “not at all”40 satisfied with the quality of the engineering graduates they hire. In another study,  Infosys found less than 2% of its 1.3 million job applicants acceptable in 200641.  Innovation and creation of new knowledge are the major areas in which universities in  the developed countries have an edge over their Indian counterparts. Investment in R&D in  developed countries is not limited to public funding, funding from the private sector especially  industry is equally important. This has helped universities and industries in such countries  maintain their competitive edge. An analysis of global R&D investments shows that the bulk of  such investments come from countries like USA (32.4%), Japan (13%) and China (9.2%). India’s  share remains low at 2.2%.  At its present stage of growth, India and other developing nations require knowledge  based value-added development of areas like pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, nanosciences,  healthcare, genetics, IT etc. Intensification and expansion of research oriented higher education  in the university system is the way forward. Such intensification and expansion would be  possible through the infusion of massive public investments that would ensure quality and help  40 Saeki, H. and Blom, A.

An alarming trend is the decline in India’s share of  world researchers, which stood at 2.2% (2007) down from 2.3% (2002). A study on India’s  research output by Thomson Reuters in 2010 has estimated India’s global share of scientific  publication to be about 3.5 per cent. On the other hand, China’s share has increased from 14%  to 21.1% during the same period (2002-2007). The numbers of PhDs produced by India are less  than half of those in US. China’s steady increase in PhDs is worth noting; in 2002 India and China  were not too far apart in the number of PhDs. However, by 2007 China has surged rapidly ahead  in terms of its research output and is almost rivaling US.  Figure 30: Share of PhD.42  The experiences of China in the field of higher education deserve a closer scrutiny and  perhaps, emulation. China launched ‘Project 211’ in 1995, as part of its national priority for the 21st century, involving important universities and colleges in 1995 with the intent of raising the  research standards of high-level universities and cultivating strategies for socio-economic  development. It subsequently launched the ‘Project 985’ in 1998 to further promote the  development and reputation of the Chinese higher education system. The project involved large  allocations of funding to select universities in order to build new research centres, improve  facilities, attract world-renowned faculty and visiting scholars etc. As a result of ‘Project 985’  nine universities in China were converted into Research Universities. The progress of these  42 Sunder. S. Higher Education Reforms in India.

It is evident from trends presented in  Figure 34a and 34b that India has started to regain the volume share of scientific publication lost during 1980’s since 2002. Based on relative share, India ranks currently 9th in the world with  respect to scientific publications in SCI Journal. Based on current trends, India could vie for a  share of about 5% from its current 3.5% as mentioned above within the next five years. This would call for planned investment and concerted actions from all the stakeholders46.  45 UNESCO Institute for Statistics as accessed on 24th October 2012 46 Biometric Study of India’s Scientific Publication Outputs during 2001-10; Evidence for Changing Trends, Dept. of Science and Technology, Government of India July 2012.  38  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 34: Trends in Publications47  a.

While there has been a  two fold increase in the growth of Teaching Staff over the last decade (Figure 38 and 39), this  has not clearly kept pace with the growth of Universities and Colleges and Enrolment (Figure  40).

The  student teacher ratio in India (24:1) is very low as compared to good institutions in other  countries, 9.5:1 in Sweden; and 13.6:1 in United States. In addition, a major factor that leads to  poor quality of teaching and learning as well as lack of research capabilities is the lack of  qualified faculty in the higher education institutions.  Figure 41: Student-teacher ratio is selected countries52  In addition to the low number of sanctioned faculty positions, faculty vacancy even in  sanctioned strength is an extremely serious problem. Due to various reasons such as ban on  recruitment, lack of funds, and reluctance of states to negotiate the long-term salary burden , a  large number of faculty positions are not filled. According to the Dhande Committee report, the  faculty strength as of 2008 was 6,99,644 with vacancies close to 40%53. Attracting faculty is a big  challenge for rural and backward areas because of lack of infrastructural support and reluctance  of teachers in moving to non-urban areas. Faculty shortage creates serious hurdles in the proper  functioning of a college or university. All activities from the basic functions of teaching and  research to curriculum development are compromised.  52 UNESCO Institute of Statistics as accessed on 24th October, 2012 and MHRD Statistics of Higher and Technical education in India, as on 30th September 2009 53 Sanjay Dhande Committee on Faculty Shortage and Performance Appraisal System,  44  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Many institutions also face acute shortage of experienced and senior faculty; this  hampers curricular development, research initiatives and the general management of  institutions. Universities departments and colleges do not suffer from this shortage as severely  as affiliated colleges do. Again, many affiliated colleges are privately owned and have limited  incentives to employ senior faculty members by paying higher salaries. Many private colleges  are now employing teachers on contract basis and paying them meager salaries, sometimes on  per lecture basis. This defeats the goals of quality teaching and learning. The Supreme Court in  its landmark judgement in T.M.A. Pai matter, had severely castigated institutions which do not  employ full time qualified faculty. It said that, “teachers are like foster parents to the students.  Can we afford to place the future of the country in hands of these hired teachers.”  Figure 42: Level-wise teaching staff54  1.2.3.1 XIth Plan Experience: Excellence  Several initiatives to improve quality were taken up in the XIth Plan. These related to  faculty improvements, use of technology, academic and governance reforms and accreditation.  These initiatives have yielded very limited results. Acute faculty shortages continue at both state  and central levels; over a half of the faculty positions in state universities and colleges are  vacant. Most of these vacancies are due to ban imposed by the state governments on filling up  faculty positions. Even in central institutions, about one-third faculty positions are vacant at any  54 University Grant Commission, Annual Report, 2010-11  45  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  point of time. In both cases, procedural delays are common. More importantly, the universities  are not able to fill the middle/senior level faculty positions for want of suitably qualified and  experienced persons. Rapid expansion of the system in recent years has exacerbated the  problem. Efforts to recruit faculty through five-year central sponsoring have also not received  enthusiastic response from states for the year of eventual increase in their payroll burdens. It  has been observed in many states that salaries of faculty especially in affiliated colleges are not  even paid in time. Sometimes salaries are not paid for months together. Under such  circumstances, it is very difficult to get existing faculty involved and remain committed to the  teaching profession.  Teach for India’s Higher Education  It is a well-known fact that many Indian students who go outside the country for higher  education are interested in returning back to the country in the field of higher education. Many  individuals who have invested five or more years of their lives to complete PhDs and post-docs  are finding themselves looking for opportunities in India. However, given the lack of structured  programs, flexible options and difference in environment, they are reluctant to return.  This presents an opportunity to create a Teach for India Higher Education Fellowship  program to provide two to three-year teaching post-docs or assistant professor positions for  fresh PhD graduates from reputed Universities abroad. This could be branded like the Teach for  India program for school teachers. It is hoped that many young faculty may stay on after the  fellowships in Indian academic posts and this influx of talent from different eco-systems will  help improve the teaching and research environment of the Indian universities. It could be open  to all new graduates in subjects where Indian universities have faculty shortages.  While it could be open to all nationalities, it might be particularly appealing to the Indian natives who may have been planning to return at some point of time to the country. A study55  done on the same area suggests that to make the program attractive, marketing of it should  stress several key messages: giving back to India, helping to build its HE capacity, and having the  opportunity to do research. The latter can be achieved by keeping teaching and administrative  loads fairly low, allowing the fellows to publish their research in leading journals, which would in  turn help raise the status of Indian universities.  55 http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/papers/download/050411_willtheyreturn.pdf as accessed on 31st October, 2012  46  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  States may consider making use of this suggestion in order to address the issue of  faculty shortage in higher educational institutions.  Independent quality assurance mechanism is a sine qua non for quality and excellence.  Unfortunately, in India, the accreditation is still optional. While institutional accreditation  through National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and program accreditation  through National Board of Accreditation (NBA) gained momentum during the XIth Plan, the coverage of institutions is still small. Only about one-third (172 out of 61256) eligible universities  and one-fifth (4529 out of 22500)57 of eligible colleges have been accredited so far. Private  universities and private colleges have shown little enthusiasm for accreditation. This means that  there is effectively no standard national level monitoring in terms of quality for most of the  educational institutions.  Figure 43: Proportion of Universities and Colleges accredited by NAAC  A concerted effort is needed to ensure that quality informs every process in higher  education. Any new scheme planned by the government must ensure that accreditation  becomes mandatory and sufficient incentives and disincentives are built into the system to  ensure that every HEI obtains accreditation.  1.2.4 Funding  Higher Education needs to be empowered, as it, and it alone helps in sustainable, social,  economic and political development of the society and some assurance of equity.  Empowerment of higher education requires liberal funding by the government. Higher  56 MHRD response to Question No. 857, Rajya Sabha dated 30th Novemeber 2012 57 XIIth Five year Plan, Planning Commission of India, New Delhi, 2012  47  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Education is widely recognized as public good, at least as a quasi public good as it produces huge  set of economic, social, cultural, demographic and political externalities. The government has  now recognized post elementary education as a Merit – 2 good (elementary education is  recognized as a merit-1 good), that needs to be financed considerably by the state. Today Higher  Education cannot be a ‘non-priority area’ anymore, and higher education institutions cannot be  treated as if they are a part of non essential sector. Therefore, Higher Education requires  sustained funding from public exchequer.  While international comparisons have their own limitations, they nevertheless provide  some broad indications on the relative positions of a country in comparison to others. Figure 44  shows the expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP.  Figure 44: Expenditure on education at a % of GDP  Total expenditure on Higher Education has increased remarkably post independence period.  From government expenditure on higher education has grown from Rs. 17crores at the  inception of planning to nearly Rs.9000crores in the early years of this decade. Figure 45 shows  the expenditure on Higher Education in India as a percentage of GDP during the fag end of the 10th and the 11th Plan period.  48  2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10  Source: Analysis of Budgeted Expenditure on Education, MHRD  Public Expenditure on Higher Education has been subject to severe budget squeeze  since the beginning of the 1990’s. In real terms, Union Government’s expenditure on Higher  Education declined from Rs.646 crores (in 1993-94 prices) to Rs.559 crores. However, since the  bulk of expenditure is incurred by state governments the total expenditure on higher education  in the country as a whole did not decline so steeply. Figure 46a and b, shows the total public  expenditure on higher education and the share of central and state government towards  expenditure in Higher Education. While it is encouraging to see that central government share in  public expenditure has increased, there is a decline in states share of public expenditure.  Therefore, there is a need for state governments to increase their share of public expenditure in  Higher Education.  49  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 45: Expenditure on Higher Education in India (As % of GDP)  GDP)  of % (as Expenditure  4.5 4 3.64 3.77 3.85 3.4 3.5 3 2.5 Expenditure on 2 Education (as % of GDP) 1.5 1.14 1.23 1.25 Higher Education as %  1.09 GDP 1  0.5 0  9 6 9 7  98 99  ------- -2000 2 0 0 1 2002 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009  1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1997 1998    2003       2010 20 11 1999  200 0 2001   2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008   2002  2009  2010  Year  Figure 46b: Share of Centre and State in Government Expenditure  Fig: Share of Centre and State in Government Expenditture on Higher  cent  Per  State Union 100 80 60 40 20 0  91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99  2000  2001  2002 R E  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 R E B E           2003  2010  2011  199 0 199 1 199 2 199 3 199 4 199 5 199 6 199 7 199 8           1999 2000 2001  2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008    200 2 200 9 201 0 Year  50  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure 46a: Government Expenditure on Higher Education in India  Figure: Government Expenditure on Higher Education in India 30000 State Union total 25000  C r 20000 I n 15000 R s . 10000 5000 0  RE RE BE 91 92 93 94 95  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Public expenditure per student on Higher Education in nominal terms has increased post  independence period but the real expenditure has registered a negative growth for the period 1990-91 to 2002-03.

Having understood the general  shortcomings, experience with the past plans and the magnitude of the challenges that face the  country in the coming years, this learning must be built into the new scheme so as to effectively  address all the relevant challenges. In the next section we look at an important and possibly the  weakest sub-section of the higher education system, the state universities; the means through  which higher education is administered and imparted to 94% of the students.  51  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for circulation not to be cited  2 State Universities  “Our university system is, in many parts, in a state of disrepair...In almost  half the districts in the country, higher education enrollments are abysmally low,  almost two-third of our universities and 90 per cent of our colleges are rated as  below average on quality parameters... I am concerned that in many states  university appointments, including that of vice-chancellors, have been politicized  and have become subject to caste and communal considerations and there are  complaints of favoritism and corruption.”  — Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 200758  With the rapid expansion of higher education institutions in India, the role and  importance of state universities cannot be understated. Many state universities are in a state of  disrepair today; they need greater financial support from the states and center, greater  responsibility and accountability for the utilization of funds, reforms in their governance  structures, academic and examination reforms and changes in the affiliation structure. Any  effort towards improving the higher education system in India cannot exclude the state  institutions from its purview. The transformation in state universities and colleges can only  ensure that we usher the country towards the goal of “knowledge society”. While centrally  funded institutions are of a very good quality, they still remain islands of excellence, catering to  the knowledge requirements of a few select students. The large mass of students in state sector  remains cut off from the quality education excellence, and this trend needs to be reversed.  Of the students studying in public institutions, only 6% (0.5 million) are enrolled in the  centrally funded public institutions while the state controlled public institutions cater to about  94% (7.9 million) of the students enrolled. Students studying in public institutions only  constitute about 42% of enrollments; the remaining 58% are enrolled in private institutions  including aided and unaided (Table 1). Most of the private institutions (especially colleges) come  under the state university systems and depend on them for administration, curriculum,  examination and other quality related aspects. It is evident that in order to achieve its objectives  of access, equity and excellence, given the number of students that state universities cater to  the thrust of future plans should be on strengthening state university system. Any new scheme  58 Prime Minister’s address at the 150th Anniversary Function of university of Mumbai, http://pmindia.nic.in/speech/content.asp?id=555 as accessed on Sept 16th, 2012  52  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  for state universities should necessarily encourage restructuring and reforms in affiliated  colleges. Even as a case is made out in this chapter for allocating greater amount of funds to the  State Universities, it is also true that the capacity of the State Universities to absorb funds is low  and any new scheme must keep this critical bottleneck in mind. Providing larger quantum of  funds cannot be the only solution; reforms in the entire state sector must be attended to  simultaneously. Emphasis must be laid on removing the hurdles in fund absorption such as  restrictive bureaucratic processes, slow decision making and archaic administrative systems etc.  Hence, the scheme must incentivize reform processes in the higher education system as well as  the Universities, which can only ensure optimum and timely utilization of funds.  Table 1: Enrollments by types of institutions (in lakhs)59  Category 2007-08 2011-12 Increase Growth Rate  (%) By type of institutions Government 68.07 84.90 16.83 4.5  (44.1%) (42.0%) Central 3.46 (2.2%) 5.10 (2.5%) 1.64 8.1 State 64.61 79.80 15.19 4.3  (41.9%) (39.5%) Private 86.41 117.10 30.97 6.4  (55.9%) (58.0%) By degree / diploma Degree 133.32 169.68 36.36 4.9  (86.5%) (84.0%) Diploma 20.89 32.33 11.32 9.1  (13.5%) (16.0%) Total 154.21 202.00 30.9% 5.6  2.1 Funding state universities  The growth in number of state institutions has been lagging in the past few plans. In the  XIth Plan, central degree awarding institutions grew at a far greater pace (13%) than degree  awarding institutions in states (4.5%). A lot of funds are invested in the creation of central  institutions even though their capacity to enroll students is comparatively less and so is their  accessibility. It is also worth noting that even though there has been an increase in the number  of both state and central institutions, enrollments have not risen in the same proportion. This  59 XIIth Five year Plan, Planning Commission of India, New Delhi, 2012  53  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  leads to the conclusion that the additional capacity created with new institutions in not being  optimally utilized. Thus along with the efforts for increasing access through new institutions, the  existing capacities must be fully exploited.  This difference in growth of state institutions (Table 2) also causes disparities in access  and equity. Despite the heavy burden of enrollments on state institutions, they have not grown  at the same pace as the central institutions. Meanwhile, the vacuum has been filled by private  colleges. Though private colleges also increase access, the aims of equitable growth and quality  enhancement are not necessarily fulfilled. Commercialization of education has already led to  huge distortions in the educational landscape, socially as well as spatially. 80 percent of  professional institutions are located in five states, mostly controlled by private sector. Education  priorities cannot be left to vagaries of market forces. Commercialization entails that quality  education becomes synonymous with affordability. The goals of equity and inclusion, the  fundamental pillars of policy making in any democracy, might be the first casualties if unbridled  profit making is instituted as a norm for the educational institutions in the private sector.

As early as 1986, the National  60 XIIth Five year Plan, Planning Commission of India, New Delhi, 2012  54  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  education Policy61, while dwelling upon the expansion of higher education, mentions the  increasing support that the state will require from Government of India in order to develop new  institutions and fund existing ones. Government spending on higher education has grown over  the years however but; the growth has not been commensurate with the increase in enrollment  and the rise in demand for better quality in education. The expenditure on public education  institutions has fallen short of need and created the demand for private investment in  education. Over the years, while the central funding has been increasing at an impressive rate,  the state funding has not kept in pace with the central expenditure.

The commission also  argued against over dependence on private sector in education development. It stated, “It is  undesirable to regard fees as a source of revenue. They are the most regressive form of  taxation; fall more heavily on the poorer classes of society and act as an anti-egalitarian force.”  Kothari Commission found that the then existing levels of fee contributions were much higher in  India than in the educationally advanced and richer counter such as US and UK. The commission  observed, “in the long run education to some extent is self-financing because the increased  incomes generated by a relatively better educated labour force would provide resources for  greater allocation to education...additional resource are generated through the process of  economic growth.” The commission also observed, “the education tends to augment the flow of  national product, though with some time-lag...”  Drawing from these reports, the Education Policy 1986, as modified in 1992, made a  special mention of the immediate need for arresting the growing trend of commercialization of  61 62 National Planning Education Policy, 1986 Commission, as accessed on 24th October, 2012  55  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  education. The CABE Committee on Higher Education funding, which submitted its report in  2005, stated “... reduction in state funding for higher education, corresponding cost recovery  measures and rapid growth in privatization of higher education – all begin to produce serious  problems on access, quality, equity and efficiency in higher education.”  Another aspect of funding is the central allocations to state institutions in comparison  with central institutions. State system receives disproportionately small amounts of grants. The Yashpal Committee63 pointed out it its report that even though state universities are a primary  responsibility of the states, the development of students in both state and central institutions is  a national responsibility and there cannot be any discrimination between the two.  In the last three plan periods there has been clear evidence of the difference between  allocations made to central and state institutions. As illustrated in Figure 22 and 23, central  institutions have been the main beneficiary of the grants. In the XIth Plan this gap has widened  further, the funds to states have only been one-sixth of those given to state institutions.  Figure49: Funding (in crores) state vs. central institutions64  63 Report of ‘The Committee to Advise on Renovation and Rejuvenation of higher education”, 2009 64 Annual Report 2010-11, University Grants Commission  56  1.60%  Draft for circulation not to be cited  -I-GER  1.40%  1.20%  1.00%  0.80%  0.60%  0.40%  Figure 50: Expenditure on Higher Education as a % of GSDP for States 65  Expenditure on Higher Education as a % of GSDP  0.20%  ?  4  0.00%  Tamil Nadu  Jammu & Kashmir  Karnataka  Nagaland  Andhra Pradesh  Meghalaya  Uttar Pradesh  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan  Gujarat  Punjab  Assam Rajasthan  Jharkhand  Delhi  Goa Himachal Pradesh  Sikkim Mizoram  Haryana Uttarakhand Puducherry  Maharashtra  Chhattisgarh  Madhya Pradesh  Odisha  Bihar Kerala Manipur  Tripura  West Bengali Arunachal Pradesh  65 Refer to Annexure l: States at a Glance  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for circulation not to be cited  The dwindling support to state institutions can be a recipe for disaster and there is  immediate need to make the states realize this fact. In addition to the meager funding to state  institutions, the states themselves do not spend adequate proportion of the Gross State  Domestic Product (GSDP) on higher education. The average spend is about 0.5% of GSDP with  figures as low as 0.14% for Maharashtra and Jharkhand (Figure 50, 51). States of Uttar Pradesh,  Jharkhand, and West Bengal have very low GERs and very low % spends on higher education.  States such as Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, which have higher institutional density but low or  average spend on higher education, most likely have high degree of private participation in  higher education. This again creates distortions in the state Higher Education systems.  States such as Goa, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerela, Tripura and Mizoram have  shown high per capita expenditure on higher education with reasonable GERs as compared to  national average. This may also be because these states have had a history of positive  intervention in Higher Education. States such as Delhi, Pondicherry and others have a high GER,  while other states such as Maharashtra have a good GER but a low spends on higher education.  The low levels of investments in State Higher Education’s notwithstanding, the funding  to state institutions and universities is currently done on an ad-hoc basis, is poorly coordinated,  and plagued by excessive bureaucracy. Instead of receiving block grants that facilitate better  utilization of funds, institutions at times receive item-wise allocations that make it cumbersome  to use all the funds. During the 11th Plan (2007-12) a conscious attempt was made by the  central government to improve the condition of state universities by making a dedicated  allocation of Rs 22,891 crores. However, out of it only Rs 7,65266 crores was spent. This points  to a lack of absorptive capacity of the state institutions as well as the cumbersome processes for  the transfer and utilization of funds.  66 XIIth Five year Plan, Planning Commission of India, New Delhi, 2012  58  -I-GER  Draft for circulation not to be cited  [ 16,000  14,000  12,000  10,000  8,000  6,000  Per Capita Expenditure on Higher Education (18-23 years)  Figure 51: Per Capita Expenditure on Higher Education for States 67  4,000  2,000  Goa  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan  Delhi Uttarakhand  Puducherry  67 Refer to Annexure I: States at a Glance  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for circulation not to be cited  Not only the funds themselves are meager; their reach is also very limited. This fact  coupled with low levels of monitoring renders the financing completely ineffective. Under the  current financing provisions, requisitions are made on a year-on-year need basis without a  planned outlook or accountability regarding the use of funds. Lack of a cohesive vision and  planned approach is leading to uncontrolled expansion of institutions in some areas while others  continue to remain grossly underserved.  Given the limited finances the State Universities have (even after the addition of the  allocations that State governments make for higher education), it is interesting to analyze the  nature of expenditure made by them. According to the estimates of Ministry of Statistics and  Program Implementation (Annexure II), on an average, states only spend 10% of their total  expenditure on Capital works and 5% of other categories. The lion’s share goes towards paying  salaries of the employees of the higher education system. When the system is expanding and  crying need of the hour is to create additional capacity to absorb larger number of students, this  abysmal allocation on Plan and Capital items must be looked at very critically. This points to the  fact that state governments require additional support to improve and strengthen their faculty  (given the faculty shortages that the State governments already face) before they can be  expected to improve infrastructure and make other capital investments in capacity building.  2.2 Planning and funding at state level  The present system of grant disbursement is archaic. The system that started in 1956  has continued unchanged till now. The grants are not given as block grants; they are scheme and  project based. The need for a radical shift in funding criteria has been felt in an acute way.  Funding needs to be made more criteria-based and performance based. Instead of allocating  funds on the basis of demands made by higher education institutions under specific schemes,  normative and performance-linked funding would improve the performance of universities, lead  to better utilization of public funds and increase transparency and accountability within the  system. UGC which is the primary fund allocating body to state institutions, is constrained to  fund new institutions or even fund the existing ones since Section 12B of UGC Act has to be  followed. This creates a vicious cycle inhibiting new institutions to come in states. Section 12B  pre supposes all facilities and infrastructure to be in place before the funding by UGC begins. But  the colleges and universities which lack such facilities are the ones which should be supported  first. UGC was created when there were very few institutions of higher learning in the country. It  60  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  has become virtually impossible for the UGC to manage and monitor fund disbursements to a  large number of institutions. The need today is to create a new system wherein manageable  number of units are created in order to ensure proper planning and monitoring of fund  allocations and spending.  A system wide planning is required to foster synergies between the state and central  spending. The large number of institutions and their wide variety necessitate the use of state as  a unit of planning and coordination. State level planning would yield more focused solutions to  the problems of access and equity as they differ in nature and magnitude from one state to  another. The central initiatives need to be in tandem with the state level plans for improving  access, equity and quality. The National Education Policy68 had emphasized about the creation  of state Councils for higher education for a similar purpose. Though the idea gained wide  acceptability at that time, very few states actually went ahead to create these councils. In states  where there are no such councils, the decisions about policy and planning are taken at level of  bureaucrats or political executive, with no or little representation from academia. Consequently,  the entire approach reeks of favoritism, ad-hoc decision making and myopic perspectives.  A comprehensive university reform program needs to be designed and implemented  jointly by central and state governments for promoting strategic planning and recognizing  performance at the university level for accessing resources. Such a program should address gaps  at all levels, spatial, academic and physical infrastructure. It must take into account the quality  gaps, institutions-industry linkages, skill provision and curricular up-gradation. It is, therefore,  imperative for each state to prepare a comprehensive State Higher Education Perspective Plan,  which will effectively assess the needs and requirements of state institutions for a better,  equitable and balanced allocation of resources. Currently no state has such a plan, and if the  state has such a plan, neither UGC nor MHRD is aware of the same.  68 National Policy of Education, 1986  61  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  International experience: Funding and Norms Denmark69  Funding is based on the number of students who pass an exam. Institutions receive 30% to  50% of their funding based on this indicator. For instance, universities receive around $19,000  per completed bachelor degree graduate within higher technical education (which is classified  as medium cost). The disadvantage of this indicator is that institutions may artificially increase  pass rates of the exams to receive more funding. The model requires a strong quality assurance  mechanism, professional standards among university staff, and/or other funding incentives.  France70  Funding is based on the number of students enrolled and 50% of the total budget for  tertiary education is invested via formula-based funding. The advantage of the French model is  that it is easy to track spending and funding allocation information. The funding criterion is also  easy to understand for everyone. On the other hand, the disadvantage for this indicator is the  weak incentives for universities to provide quality education and ensure efficiency by avoiding  dropouts during the school year and delays in student completion.  Australia71  Australia uses performance indicators based on The Australian Graduate Survey (AGS), a  national survey of newly qualified higher education. Graduate outcomes data forms a core  component of a range of performance indicators that providing information on transition of  students from study to the labor market. Indicators are designed around graduation rates,  graduate destinations, learning outcomes, work readiness, teaching experience, teaching  resources, institutional reputation, community engagement etc. Individual Universities sign  “Compacts” with the government that include the institution’s larger mission and vision and  goals related to teaching, learning, targets of performance funding and research.  69 Planning Commission, NUEPA, World Bank Report on Higher Education, 2011 70 ibid 71 Coates, H.

The recurrent funding is divided amongst teaching funding and  research funding; non-recurrent funding is given for capital projects. The criterion for allotting  the funding includes a mixture of the type of institution, number of students, the subjects  taught and the amount and quality of research undertaken. Institutions receive most of their  funding as a ‘block grant’. They are free to spend this money according to their own priorities  within broad guidelines students.  2.3 Academic and affiliation issues in state universities  Wide variations exist across and between state universities in terms of basic provisions,  infrastructure and faculty. Fund shortage generally contributes to the unevenness in the quality  of higher education in state universities. Apart from finances, state universities also have to  grapple with bureaucratic processes, inefficient administration, lack of accountability, burden of  the affiliation system and political interferences.

Affiliated colleges enroll about 86.7% of all students and are the mainstay of  the higher education system. They enroll 90% of the undergraduate students, over 70% postgraduates and 17%74 of doctoral students. From the perspective of the state university,  affiliation system is a lucrative option of raising funds as it brings affiliation and examination  fees. However, the rampant rise in number of colleges affiliated to universities has deteriorated  the quality of higher education significantly. The active university resources and systems are  diverted towards management and conduction of exams with consequent dilution of focus on  academic quality and research. There is hardly any incentive for the affiliated colleges to  undertake any meaningful quality improvement programme in teaching and research.  There are a number of weaknesses in the existing affiliation system. First, the  relationship between state university and affiliated colleges is one of administration – affiliation,  course recognition, syllabus prescription, and examination. The university departments as  source of academic strengthening of college teachers, are generally very weak and  unstructured.  Secondly, since a typical affiliating university has to cater to hundreds of colleges, it  cannot provide customized curricula to meet the local needs of colleges, but instead offers the  same curriculum to all. The academic condition of affiliated colleges also prompts strong  resistance to curriculum revision. The university departments and affiliated colleges are then  reduced to common, minimal curriculum with no scope for improvement and innovation. One of  the scehems of UGC, namely ‘Autonomous Colleges’ scheme does encourage colleges to acquire  autonomous status, but there are systemic problems encountered, with the result that only  about 400 colleges in the country have acquired that status so far.  In most Universities, the Board of Studies is an important structure, which looks at  curriculum related issues. The composition of Board of Studies, therefore becomes very  important since the course design and framework is its responsibility. Ideally, the Board of  Studies should be different for undergraduate and postgraduate programs and institutions.  74 XIIth Five year Plan, Planning Commission of India, New Delhi, 2012  64  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  However, in some of the affiliating Universities, there is a single Board of Studies, which caters  to both undergraduate and post-graduate programs offered by colleges and Universities. For  instance, in case of most Universities in Maharashtra, there exists a single Board of Studies for  designing and implementing curriculum changes in colleges and Universities. Members of the  Board of Studies are elected as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act and  this sometimes results in undergraduate college faculty chairing the Board of Studies, where a  post-graduate faculty from a University or even the Chair of a Department from the University is  a member and has limited say in the curriculum being designed for the University. As a  consequence, faculty in the University Departments has very little say in curriculum design and  also setting up of exam papers.  In most affiliated colleges, faculty strength is inadequate and mostly filled with ad-hoc  contract faculty. This does not facilitate quality enhancement and continuity. Teaching-learning  facilities available at the affiliated colleges are inadequate with very limited access to current  literature – books and journals etc. Hence the quality of education suffers further.  The affiliation model separates teaching from assessment and separates research from  teaching. A teacher needs to use student assessment in order to adjust his or her teaching to the  needs of students and to provide feedback to students on their performance; but the affiliation  system envisages that the assessment is done away from the college. These features  significantly reduce the accountability for results. The affiliation system also means that  research is done at the university while teaching is done at the colleges, so the latest knowledge  is not available to those teaching undergraduates, except through the laborious process of  curriculum reform. In the same way, teachers of colleges are denied all opportunities of self  improvement, continuous upgradation, and access to resources and research facilities. Students  coming through the affiliated colleges miss a whole lifetime of opportunity for all round  personality development, access to good faculty, laboratories, libraries and consequently lack  both soft and applied skills. This naturally gets translated into lower levels of employability for  affiliated college pass-outs.  The state university departments also lack capabilities and the wherewithal to support  and strengthen the quality of curriculum and teachers in affiliated colleges. Since university  departments are short of faculty, having had no regular recruitment since a long time, they are  65  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  forced to manage with minimum faculty – a few seniors and the rest being contract faculty.  Quality teaching and research is not possible in such a context.  Learning from other States75  Maharashtra and West Bengal (Kumar, 2009)76 have embarked on comprehensive  legislative reforms in higher education. States such as Karnataka are devising strategies of  addressing the affiliation issue through a single university managing both the affiliated  colleges and the post graduate and research programmes through separate units.  Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal have robust and effective buffer bodies  State  Council for Higher Education – to assist the states’ higher education departments to re-think the  role of the university.  Formation of Councils has been a less positive experience in Maharashtra, where the Council has not met for two years (Kumar, 2010)77. However, Dr.AniL Kakodkar, has recently  recommended setting up of the Maharashtra State Council for Higher Education and Development (MAHED) as a standalone independent statutory body with appropriate and  adequate autonomy.  Finally, the lack of mobility, differentials in salary, retirement age and benefits between  affiliated colleges and state universities in relation to centrally funded universities and booming  private sector institutions is drawing out the best faculty from state universities. In such an  academic environment, the economically blessed and bright students enroll in central  universities and private institutions leaving a large mass of students from rural, tribal and underprivileged communities to enroll in state universities (Kumar & S.Parasuraman, 201178).  Thus, the present system tends to perpetuate inequities rather than reducing them and the  affiliated colleges (public) stand at the bottom of this academic caste hierarchy. This condition is  not conducive to producing high quality students capable of contributing to scientific, economic  and social development. A key element of State Higher Education reform, therefore, must be to  75 World Bank Report on Reforms in Higher Education, Madhya Pradesh, 2012 76 Kumar, B.V., Governance Reforms in State Universities. Economic & Political Weekly, 2009 77 Kumar, B.V., Implementation of the Maharashtra University Act, Economic & Political Weekly, 2009 78 Kumar, B. V. & Parsuraman, S. Devising Strategies for 12th Plan, Improving Financing and Governance of State Universities, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, 2011  66  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  address the affiliation system as a whole and quality of higher education in affiliated colleges, in  particular. The Yashpal Committee79 report talks about the urgent need for improving the  condition and quality of affiliated institutions as they have a bulk of enrollments. It is pointed  out that good affiliated colleges sometimes suffer due to the bureaucracy at the university level  while some good universities suffer because of the limited vision of affiliated colleges and their  inability to accept change. The committee suggested that better colleges be allowed to function  separately from the university to ‘lighten the load’ of the university in general administrative  and examination work for colleges.  The National Knowledge Commission80 recommended reforms in the system of  affiliated undergraduate colleges. It put forth the idea of creating department-based universities  and giving greater autonomy to existing colleges. As a part of his report on higher education  submitted on behalf of National Knowledge Commission, Sam Pitroda argued for higher  education reforms, adoption of course credit system, decentralization of examination system,  internal assessments as well as criteria-based resource allocation for strategic growth in higher  education. Another important suggestion was the setting up of the central and state Boards of  Undergraduate education to control quality, conduct examinations and reduce the  administrative burden of universities in terms of affiliated colleges.  There can be multiple ways of improving the affiliation system. The first option is to  reduce the total number of affiliating colleges by encouraging the better performing colleges to  become autonomous. The better affiliating colleges could be encouraged, with additional  support as necessary, to become approved as autonomous by the University Grants  Commission. By becoming ‘autonomous’, a college would gain academic autonomy – and so  become responsible for curriculum and assessment aspects – as well as administrative  autonomy over its budget, as also becoming eligible to receive funds directly from UGC. An  autonomous college does not, however, have the right to award a degree. Hence, autonomous  colleges must be encouraged to develop into Universities. In 2011, there were about 37181  autonomous colleges in the country; such colleges can be groomed over time into Universities  79 Report of ‘The Committee to Advise on Renovation and Rejuvenation of higher education”, 2009 80 National Knowledge Commission Report, 2007 81 Annual Report 2011, University Grants Commission  67  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  that share resources and expertise with the colleges surrounding them. A good example of the  same is the Presidency College, Kolkata that was granted University status.  The bigger task, however is to improve the quality of education provided in the larger  number of colleges. One option is to establish a specific unit of the proposed State Higher  Education Councils or the affiliating university to monitor and built capacity in these colleges.  Similarly, it would be possible to establish one University exclusively for affiliations, (or a dual  Model for a few Universities like in the case that is being proposed in Karnataka) with the  remaining become exclusively teaching/research institutions. However, such initiatives should  not defeat the very concept of university, as laid down by the Radhakrishnan Commission.  One of the other models of managing the problem of affiliation is to have the University  divided into several campuses with each having colleges around its vicinity affiliated to those  campuses. This model is being currently discussed in Maharashtra in the case of University of  Mumbai. Such a model would help in ensuring that colleges are regularly monitored for quality.  A possible suggestion that the more advanced colleges “mentor” the newer ones could also be  examined by the states.  As noted above, a key constraint on reform of the affiliation system is that affiliating  universities receive a significant proportion of their revenues from affiliating colleges. It  therefore implies that the issue of financing of state universities must also be considered  alongside structural reforms.  2.4 Governance issues in state universities  There have been many concerns regarding the internal governance and administration  of universities. There are multiple points of influence by external agencies in internal bodies of  the universities, notably in the Executive Council and the Finance Committee. The Chancellor or  representatives of the state Government nominate the external people that undermine the  administrative power of the Vice Chancellor in two critical bodies, notably the Executive Council  and the Finance Committee, thus hindering the smooth functioning of the university. Further, it  creates multiple points where consensus between external stakeholders (Chancellor and  government) needs to be reached.  Different states and central Government follow different patterns for selection of Vice  Chancellors, which require some deliberation. How a university, especially a new one, evolves  and grows is dependent upon the leadership and vision of person who heads it. Hence the  68  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  importance of the role of the first Vice Chancellor of the university cannot be overemphasized.  Also, subsequent appointments need to be made with great care, after using appropriate and  fair search methods by credible people. It is therefore imperative that prescribed procedures in  these matters are adhered to, in order to ensure transparency and selection of deserving  candidates. Selection of Vice Chancellors should be a process in which there should be least  political interference, if not nil. But the trend in some of the states is quite disturbing, wherein  the selection of VCs is made through considerations other than purely of merit and leadership  qualities. The higher education sector is greatly in need of professionals to manage the  administrative affairs of universities and institutions. Like the health sector, with professional  cadre of hospital management and administration, there is a need to develop professionals for  the higher education sector also. Given the heavy involvement of the government in the sector,  the option of outsourcing certain functions has not been explored traditionally. However, it is  time to look at the option of bringing in specialized agencies to undertake functions which are  not the core functions of higher educational institutions. Academic leadership is another area of  deficiency; there are not enough number of academicians who have been groomed to take  positions of responsibility in institutions. Academic Staff Colleges in states may have to be  rejuvenated and strengthened to bridge this gap.  Autonomy must also simultaneously inculcate a greater sense of responsibility and  accountability. This can only be ensured if the institutional and systemic reforms are carried out  within the university system. Therefore, while minimizing external influences on the university  governance, the internal process and mechanisms need to be made more democratic and  transparent. The students, faculty and even non-teaching staff, parents etc must become  partners and participants in the decision-making processes. The need is to adopt a systematic  and well-calibrated program, which encourages competition amongst institutions for excellence  and prestige.  2.5 Autonomy of state universities  There are generally three main forms of autonomy: academic, financial, administrative.  While the universities currently have some level of administrative autonomy, there is a need to  devolve more authority to the universities in the areas of academic, finance and human  resources. For example, the universities should be recognized as experts in academic matters  and be given the authority to take all decisions including curriculum and examinations. In the  69  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  areas of finance, the universities could be given autonomy to manage their own budgets  including sourcing their own funds and authorization to keep them subject to well-defined audit  and reporting parameters. In the areas of human resources, it is proposed that universities  should be allowed to select and recruit their own staff (both academic and non-academic). This  gives the university more flexibility and enhances its effectiveness and competitiveness; leading  to an overall improvement in the quality of education.  In essence, it can be said that reforms in the entire state higher education sector are  long over-due and any further delay can only exacerbate the glaring inefficiencies in functioning  of state institutions and derail the entire process of transformation of state higher education  sector. The new scheme is designed to spur the states to undertaken all these reforms in a  holistic manner.  70  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  3 Rationale for Strategic Intervention  The success of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan  (RMSA) has led to greater demand for higher education. The discussions in the previous sections  regarding the condition of state higher education institutions, their importance in the higher  education system and the limitation of University Grants Commission point towards the need to  undertake strategic interventions for the improvement of higher education with respect to state  higher education institutions. There is a need to establish a new institutional mechanism, which  makes every stakeholder a partner in the process of higher education transformation.  The current method of funding state universities and colleges through the UGC route  needs to be reviewed. While the state Governments feel that the money directly flows to  universities and College without the knowledge of the states (therefore they have no reasons to  monitor them), the universities and colleges feel that very often the procedural bottlenecks and  red-tapism lead to enormous delay in the disbursement of funds and resultant under-utilization  of resources at the institutional level. There has also been by and large an issue of a lack of  absorptive capacity at the institutional level, which often results in the resources not being  utilized completely. Thus, there is a need for a scheme that focuses on and incentivizes  governance reforms, process re-engineering and related issues at the state and institutional  level. There are multiple mechanisms in extant schemes that can be used as models for  improving the funding and monitoring processes (such as the Pradhan Mantry Gram Sadak  Yojana, National Rural Health Mission and other CSS models), the financial devolution scheme82  and the three tiered outcome quality monitoring method which will help in improving control  and reduce transaction costs.  UGC can only fund those HEIs, which are 2f and 12B compliant. As of 31st March 2011,  the higher education sector consists of 623 universities and 33,093 central/state/private  colleges. 171 Universities of these are not covered under Section 12B of UGC Act and only 6,417 colleges are eligible for central grants under 12B and 2f83 (Figure 52). That leaves a significant  number of colleges and universities not eligible for UGC grants. A new scheme is really needed  to ensure that all colleges and universities (public funded) must receive the requisite state and  central support in order to reach critical levels of efficiency and infrastructure.  82 XIIth Finance Commission 83 University Grants Commission Annual Report, 2010-11  71  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  Figure52: Coverage of colleges and universities by UGC  Unfortunately many of the institutions in the non-12B and 2f category are devoid of any  resources from the UGC, thereby making them financially crippled despite the fact that many of  them contribute significantly to the triad principles of access, equity and excellence. Any  support to this set of non-12B and non-2f institutions will require a change in the statutory  provisions in the UGC Act, for them to be eligible for grants. Such a process is time consuming  since it is legislative in nature. With the XIIth Plan already in operation, it is desirable that  support to the entire state university System may be provided by this proposed new mission  mode project, while a long term solution would be to reform the statutory regulatory bodies at  the national level.  The Twelfth Plan document also underlines the need to provide significantly more  central funding to State higher education.  “There will be a strategic shift in the manner in which State universities and colleges,  which account for 40% enrolment, will be funded and supported by the Central Government. In  place of central funds directly or via the UGC for individual universities and colleges across  different States, central funding would be done for the States higher education system as a  whole. This is essential for four reasons. First, the circumstances and level of development of  higher education varies widely across the states. Due to this variance, different States require  different types of interventions and support. Second, the Indian higher education is now too big  for effective planning and coordination, State higher education systems are more manageable  units. Third, it is seen that mobility of students across the States is minimal except for top-tier  72  Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan Draft for Circulation – Not to be cited  institutions that attract students from all over the country or North-eastern region, where  students in large numbers move out for higher studies. Finally, limited central funding could be  strategically used as a powerful tool for change in chosen matters and central funding could  stimulate competition between states. Thus, the States are effective units for planned and  coordinated development of higher education.  The central funding would be used to induce the States to increase government spending  on higher education. States would be encouraged to fill up large teacher vacancies in the state  institutions. This would be used to reduce gaps in higher educational attainments; create  enabling environment to undertake academic and governance reforms which includes reforming  affiliating college system to promote quality and excellence, promote clustering approach, make  provision for common facilities for institutions. The plan should specifically address the problem  of faculty shortages and create enabling environment for upgrading the curricula and promoting  innovative pedagogic practices. This plan should lay foundation for high quality state universities  and colleges based on performance linked competitive grants. Such a plan should take a holistic  view and take within its purview central as well as private institutions, so that all three segments  of higher education within the state can develop to bring about quantifiable change. By  encouraging private investment including public-private partnerships, encouraging norms based  funding and internal resources generation, the plan should build on a financially viable model.  Central funding should be based on ‘State Higher Education Plans’ prepared jointly by  the State Government (involving the State Council for Higher Education). The State must present  their plans that encompass the different segments of their tertiary education, including private  education. The funding may be done through RUSA. This should have a clear focus on ‘Triple Es’ – Expansion, Equity and Excellence through academic and governance reforms”84.  The Committee headed by Sri B. K. Chaturvedi, constituted by Planning Commission had  recommended amalgamating plethora of centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) presently running  concurrently in order to harmonize the objectives and also to achieve economies of scale. It had  recommended the integration, also keeping in mind the fact that different institutional  structures and administrative set ups were being created which at times led to parallel schemes  aiming at similar objectives. Hence, the Planning Commission had requested to Ministry to  examine the possibility of amalgamating different CSSs catering to similar objectives. The new  CSS, discussed in the subsequent section, will be an instrument to harmonize national programs  84 XIIth Five Year Plan, Planning Commission, 2012. 73
